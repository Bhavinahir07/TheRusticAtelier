For the Soup Base:
    6 to 8 ears of fresh sweet corn
    2 tbsp unsalted butter
    1 large yellow onion, chopped
    1 celery stalk, finely chopped
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1 small potato (like a Yukon Gold), peeled and diced (acts as a natural thickener)
    Salt and freshly ground white pepper (or black pepper)
For the Soup:
    4 cups (approx. 1 liter) low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth
    1 bay leaf
For Finishing:
    ½ cup (120ml) heavy cream
    Fresh chives or basil, finely chopped, for garnish
    A pinch of cayenne pepper (optional, for a slight kick)

1. Prepare the Corn
    Shuck the corn and remove all the silk.
    Stand an ear of corn on its end in a large, wide bowl. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut down the sides to remove the kernels. Repeat with all ears.
    Crucial Step: Once all kernels are removed, use the back of your knife to scrape down all sides of the stripped cobs. This will release the "corn milk," a starchy, flavorful liquid. Add this milk to the bowl of kernels.
    Break the cobs in half and set them aside.
2. Sauté the Aromatics
    In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion and celery. Sauté, stirring occasionally, for 7-10 minutes, until the vegetables are very soft and translucent. Do not let them brown.
    Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more until fragrant.
3. Build and Simmer the Soup
    Add the corn kernels (and their milk), the diced potato, the reserved broken cobs, the broth, and the bay leaf to the pot. Season with a pinch of salt and white pepper.
    Comment: Adding the cobs to the pot is the most important secret to a deep, authentic corn flavor. They will release all their residual sweetness and starch into the broth.
    Increase the heat and bring the soup to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes and corn kernels are completely tender.
4. Blend the Soup
    Remove the pot from the heat. Use tongs to find and discard the corn cobs and the bay leaf.
    Use an immersion blender to carefully blend the soup directly in the pot until it is completely smooth and velvety.
    Alternative Method: If using a stand blender, let the soup cool slightly. Working in batches, vent the lid (remove the center cap and cover with a towel) and blend until smooth. Return the puréed soup to the pot.
5. Finish with Cream
    Place the pot of puréed soup back over low heat.
    Slowly stir in the heavy cream and the optional pinch of cayenne pepper.
    Continue to heat the soup gently for 3-5 minutes until it is warmed through. Do not let the soup boil after adding the cream, as this can cause it to curdle.
6. Serve
    Taste the soup one last time and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. The soup's sweetness may require a good pinch of salt to balance it.
    Ladle the hot, creamy soup into bowls. Garnish with fresh chopped chives or basil and a final crack of white pepper.
