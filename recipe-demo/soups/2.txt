For the Soup Base:
    1 tbsp olive oil
    2 tbsp unsalted butter
    1 large yellow onion, roughly chopped
    1 large carrot, roughly chopped
    1 celery stalk, roughly chopped
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    1 tsp salt
    ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
For the Soup:
    1 (28-ounce / 800g) can whole peeled tomatoes (San Marzano recommended)
    2 cups (approx. 480ml) vegetable or chicken broth
    2-3 sprigs fresh thyme (or ½ tsp dried thyme)
    1 bay leaf
    1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
For Finishing:
    ½ cup (120ml) heavy cream
    Fresh basil or chives, for garnish

1. Sauté the Aromatic Base
    Place a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the olive oil and butter.
    Once the butter is melted, add the chopped onion, carrot, and celery. Sauté, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes, until the vegetables are very soft and the onion is translucent.
    Comment: This step builds the foundational flavor of the soup. Don't rush it; you want the vegetables to soften and sweeten, not brown.
    Add the minced garlic, salt, and pepper, and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the garlic is fragrant.
2. Build and Simmer the Soup
    Add the entire can of whole peeled tomatoes (with their juices), the broth, thyme sprigs, and the bay leaf. Use a wooden spoon to gently break up the tomatoes in the pot.
    If using, stir in the optional sugar, which helps to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.
    Bring the soup to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the soup simmer gently for at least 20-30 minutes. This allows all the flavors to meld together.
3. Blend the Soup
    After simmering, remove the pot from the heat. Fish out and discard the thyme stems (if you used whole sprigs) and the bay leaf.
    Use an immersion blender to carefully blend the soup directly in the pot until it is completely smooth and velvety.
    Alternative Method: If you don't have an immersion blender, let the soup cool slightly. Working in batches, carefully transfer the soup to a stand blender. Vent the blender lid (e.g., remove the center cap and cover with a kitchen towel) to allow steam to escape, and blend until smooth. Return the puréed soup to the pot.
4. Finish with Cream
    Place the pot with the blended soup over low heat.
    Slowly stir in the heavy cream. Continue to heat the soup gently for another 3-5 minutes until it is warmed through.
    Tip: Do not let the soup come to a boil after adding the cream, as this can cause it to curdle.
5. Serve
    Taste the soup one last time and adjust seasoning if necessary (more salt or pepper).
    Ladle the hot, creamy soup into bowls. Garnish with a drizzle of olive oil, a swirl of extra cream, or a sprinkle of fresh basil or chives.
    Serve immediately, ideally with a grilled cheese sandwich for dipping.
