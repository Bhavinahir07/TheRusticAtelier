For the Beef:
    2 lbs (approx. 900g) beef chuck, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch cubes
    ¼ cup (approx. 30g) all-purpose flour
    1 tsp salt
    ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
    2 tbsp olive oil
For the Soup:
    1 large yellow onion, chopped
    2 large carrots, peeled and chopped
    3 celery stalks, chopped
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    6 cups (approx. 1.5 liters) low-sodium beef broth
    1 (14.5-ounce / 411g) can diced tomatoes, undrained
    ¾ cup (approx. 150g) pearl barley, rinsed
    1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
    2-3 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried thyme)
    1 bay leaf
For Finishing:
    ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
    Salt and pepper, to taste

1. Prepare and Brown the Beef
    Pat the beef cubes dry with a paper towel. In a medium bowl (or a large plastic bag), combine the flour, 1 tsp salt, and ½ tsp pepper. Add the beef cubes and toss to lightly coat them in the seasoned flour.
    Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
    Working in two batches, add the beef to the pot in a single layer. Sear, undisturbed, for 3-4 minutes per side, until a deep, brown crust forms. Remove the browned beef to a clean plate and set aside.
    Comment: This is the most important step for flavor. Do not overcrowd the pot, or the beef will steam instead of sear. The browned fond left in the pot is the foundation of your soup.
2. Sauté the Aromatics (Mirepoix)
    Reduce the heat to medium. To the same pot (do not clean it), add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery.
    Sauté, stirring often, for 8-10 minutes, until the vegetables have softened and the onion is translucent. Use your spoon to scrape up some of the browned bits from the bottom of the pot as the vegetables release their moisture.
    Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more until fragrant.
3. Deglaze and Build the Soup
    Pour in about ½ cup of the beef broth. Use a wooden spoon to vigorously scrape the bottom of the pot, releasing all the remaining browned fond. Let the liquid bubble and reduce for a minute.
    Add the seared beef (and any juices from the plate) back into the pot.
    Add the remaining beef broth, the undrained diced tomatoes, the rinsed pearl barley, Worcestershire sauce, thyme sprigs, and the bay leaf.
4. Simmer the Soup
    Stir everything to combine and increase the heat to bring the soup to a boil.
    Once it is boiling, immediately reduce the heat to low, cover the pot tightly, and let it simmer gently for 1.5 hours (90 minutes).
    Tip: Stir the soup occasionally to ensure the barley doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot.
5. Finish and Serve
    After 1.5 hours, uncover the soup. The beef should be fork-tender, and the barley should be soft but still pleasantly chewy. If the beef isn't tender enough, simmer for another 15-20 minutes.
    Remove the pot from the heat. Fish out and discard the bay leaf and the thyme stems.
    Stir in the fresh chopped parsley. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed. The soup will likely need a good pinch of both.
    Ladle the hot, thick soup into bowls and serve immediately.
