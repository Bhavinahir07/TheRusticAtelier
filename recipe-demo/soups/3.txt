For the Mushroom Base:
    1 tbsp olive oil
    2 tbsp unsalted butter
    1.5 lbs (approx. 680g) cremini (baby bella) mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced
    1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    2 sprigs fresh thyme (or ½ tsp dried thyme)
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper
For the Roux and Soup:
    3 tbsp unsalted butter
    ¼ cup (approx. 30g) all-purpose flour
    4 cups (approx. 1 liter) vegetable or chicken broth (low sodium)
For Finishing:
    ½ cup (120ml) heavy cream
    1 tbsp dry sherry (optional, but highly recommended for depth)
    Fresh chives or parsley, for garnish

1. Sauté the Mushrooms
    Place a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and 2 tbsp of butter.
    Once the butter is melted and foaming, add the sliced mushrooms. Do not overcrowd the pot. If necessary, do this in two batches.
    Let the mushrooms cook, undisturbed, for 3-5 minutes until the bottoms are browned. Then, stir and continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes, until they have released their moisture and are deeply browned and caramelized.
    Comment: This is the most important step for flavor. Grey, steamed mushrooms will result in a bland soup. You are looking for a deep, golden-brown color.
    Using a slotted spoon, remove about ½ cup of the browned mushrooms and set them aside for garnish.
2. Sauté the Aromatics
    To the same pot, add the finely chopped onion. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring, until the onion is soft and translucent.
    Add the minced garlic and the fresh thyme leaves (removed from the stems). Cook for 1-2 minutes more until fragrant. Season generously with salt and pepper.
3. Make the Roux
    Add the remaining 3 tbsp of butter to the pot. Once it melts, sprinkle the all-purpose flour over the vegetables.
    Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes until the flour is fully incorporated and has a chance to "cook out" its raw taste. It will form a thick paste.
4. Build and Simmer the Soup
    Gradually pour in the broth, whisking constantly as you add it. Add the first cup of broth slowly, whisking vigorously to create a smooth, clump-free paste before adding the rest.
    Add all the sautéed mushrooms (except the reserved garnish) back into the pot.
    Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer gently, partially covered, for 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
5. Blend the Soup
    Remove the pot from the heat and discard the thyme stems (if you used whole sprigs).
    Use an immersion blender to blend the soup directly in the pot. You can blend it until it's completely smooth and velvety, or leave it slightly chunky for more texture, depending on your preference.
    Alternative Method: Carefully transfer the soup in batches to a stand blender. Vent the lid and blend until smooth. Return the soup to the pot.
6. Finish with Cream
    Place the pot back over low heat. Stir in the heavy cream and the optional dry sherry.
    Allow the soup to heat through gently for 2-3 minutes.
    Tip: Do not let the soup boil after adding the cream, as it can curdle.
7. Serve
    Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.
    Ladle the hot soup into bowls. Garnish with the reserved browned mushrooms and a sprinkle of fresh chives or parsley.
