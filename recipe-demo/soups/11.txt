For the Aromatic Base:
    1 tbsp olive oil
    2 tbsp unsalted butter
    1 large yellow onion, chopped
    2 large carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds or half-moons
    3 celery stalks, chopped
    3-4 cloves garlic, minced
    1 tsp salt
    ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
For the Soup:
    8 cups (approx. 2 liters) high-quality, low-sodium chicken broth
    2-3 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried thyme)
    1 bay leaf
    2 cups cooked, shredded chicken (poached chicken breast or meat from a rotisserie chicken works perfectly)
    4-6 ounces (115-170g) wide egg noodles
For Finishing:
    ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
    1 tsp fresh lemon juice (optional, but brightens all the flavors)

1. Sauté the Aromatic Base (Mirepoix)
    In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and melt the butter over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes. The vegetables should become soft and sweet, and the onion should be translucent.
    Comment: This "sweating" step is crucial for developing the soup's sweet, aromatic foundation. Do not brown the vegetables; you just want to soften them.
    Add the minced garlic, 1 tsp of salt, and ½ tsp of pepper, and cook for 1-2 minutes more until the garlic is fragrant.
2. Build and Simmer the Broth
    Pour in the chicken broth. Add the fresh thyme sprigs (if using) and the bay leaf.
    Increase the heat and bring the soup to a boil. Once boiling, immediately reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the soup simmer gently for 15-20 minutes. This step allows all the flavors from the vegetables and herbs to meld into the broth.
3. Cook the Noodles (Recommended Method)
    While the soup simmers, bring a separate, medium pot of salted water to a boil.
    Add the egg noodles and cook according to the package directions until al dente (tender but with a firm bite).
    Drain the noodles well.
    Tip (Crucial for Best Texture): Cooking the noodles separately is the best way to ensure they are perfectly cooked and, more importantly, prevents them from absorbing all your broth overnight, which would leave you with a thick stew instead of a soup.
4. Finish the Soup
    After the broth has simmered, remove and discard the thyme stems and the bay leaf.
    Stir in the cooked, shredded chicken and the optional (but recommended) fresh lemon juice. Let the chicken heat through in the gentle simmer for 2-3 minutes.
    If you are not cooking noodles separately: Add the dry egg noodles to the simmering broth and cook for 7-10 minutes, or until tender. Be aware of the tip in Step 3.
5. Serve
    Place a generous portion of the cooked, drained noodles into each individual serving bowl.
    Ladle the hot soup (with the broth, vegetables, and chicken) over the noodles.
    Garnish generously with fresh parsley and serve immediately.
