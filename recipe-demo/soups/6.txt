For the Clams (Option 1 - Fresh):
    3-4 lbs fresh hard-shell clams (Quahogs, Cherrystones, or Littlenecks)
    2 cups water
For the Clams (Option 2 - Canned):
    2 (10-ounce) cans whole baby clams, undrained
    1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice
For the Chowder Base:
    4 ounces (approx. 115g) salt pork, rinsed and finely diced
    1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
    2 celery stalks, finely chopped
    3 tbsp unsalted butter
    ⅓ cup (approx. 40g) all-purpose flour
    1.5 lbs (approx. 680g) waxy or all-purpose potatoes (like Yukon Gold or Red Bliss), peeled and cut into ½-inch dice
    1 bay leaf
    1 sprig fresh thyme (or ¼ tsp dried thyme)
For Finishing:
    1 ½ cups heavy cream
    ½ cup whole milk
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
    Oyster crackers, for serving

1. Prepare the Clams
    If using Fresh Clams: Scrub the clams well. In a large pot, bring the 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the clams, cover, and steam for 5-8 minutes, until they have all opened. Discard any that remain closed.
    Strain the cooking liquid (now "clam broth") through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a bowl and reserve it.
    When cool enough to handle, remove the clam meat from the shells and give it a rough chop. Set aside. You should have about 2 cups of broth; add bottled clam juice if you are short.
    If using Canned Clams: Drain the clams, reserving the juice from both cans. Combine this juice with the bottled clam juice. Set the clams and the total juice aside.
2. Render the Salt Pork
    In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, cook the diced salt pork over medium-low heat.
    Stir occasionally until the fat has rendered out and the small pork pieces are golden brown and crispy, about 8-10 minutes.
    Using a slotted spoon, remove the crispy pork bits (now "croutons") to a paper-towel-lined plate and set them aside for garnish. Leave the rendered fat in the pot.
3. Sauté Aromatics and Make the Roux
    To the fat in the pot, add the chopped onion and celery. Sauté over medium heat for 6-8 minutes, until the vegetables are softened and translucent, but not browned.
    Add the 3 tbsp of butter and let it melt. Sprinkle the all-purpose flour over the vegetables and stir constantly for 2 minutes. This cooks out the raw flour taste and creates the roux.
4. Build and Simmer the Soup
    While whisking constantly, slowly pour in the reserved clam broth (from either fresh or canned clams). Whisk until the mixture is smooth and begins to thicken.
    Add the diced potatoes, bay leaf, and thyme sprig.
    Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are completely tender when pierced with a fork.
5. Finish the Chowder
    Once the potatoes are tender, remove the pot from the heat. Discard the bay leaf and thyme stem.
    Stir in the heavy cream, whole milk, and the reserved chopped clams.
    Tip: Do not add the clams while the soup is boiling. The residual heat is all that's needed to cook them through. Boiling them will make them tough and rubbery.
    Return the pot to very low heat and allow the soup to warm through for 2-3 minutes. Do not let it boil again.
6. Serve
    Taste the chowder. It will likely be salty from the pork and clam juice, but add freshly ground black pepper and more salt only if needed.
    Ladle the hot chowder into bowls. Garnish with the reserved crispy salt pork pieces and serve immediately with oyster crackers.
