For the Soup Base:
    3 tbsp unsalted butter
    1 large yellow onion, chopped
    2 celery stalks, chopped
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper
For the Soup:
    2.5 lbs (approx. 1.15kg) starchy potatoes (like Russets or Yukon Golds), peeled and diced into ½-inch cubes
    4 cups (approx. 1 liter) low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
    1-2 sprigs fresh thyme (or ½ tsp dried thyme)
    1 bay leaf
For Finishing:
    ½ to 1 cup (120-240ml) heavy cream (or whole milk for a lighter version)
    Optional Toppings: Cooked bacon crumbles, shredded cheddar cheese, sliced green onions or chives.

1. Sauté the Aromatics
    In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion and celery. Sauté, stirring occasionally, for 7-10 minutes, until the vegetables have softened and the onion is translucent.
    Comment: Building this flavor base is key. You want the vegetables to be fully soft and sweet, not browned.
    Add the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes more, until fragrant. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.
2. Build and Simmer the Soup
    Add the diced potatoes, the broth, the fresh thyme sprigs (if using), and the bay leaf to the pot. Stir to combine.
    Tip: Ensure the broth covers the potatoes. If it doesn't, add a bit more broth or a splash of water.
    Increase the heat and bring the soup to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes.
    The soup is ready for the next step when the potatoes are completely tender and can be easily pierced with a fork.
3. Blend for Creaminess
    Remove the pot from the heat. Fish out and discard the thyme stems and the bay leaf.
    Use an immersion blender to partially blend the soup. Pulse the blender just 4-5 times. This will purée some of the potatoes, creating a thick, creamy base, while leaving plenty of whole, tender chunks for texture.
    Alternative Method: Carefully transfer 2-3 cups of the soup (with plenty of potatoes) to a stand blender. Vent the lid and blend until smooth. Pour this puréed portion back into the main pot and stir to combine.
4. Finish the Soup
    Place the pot back over low heat.
    Stir in ½ cup of heavy cream. If you prefer an even richer, creamier soup, add up to 1 full cup.
    Continue to heat the soup gently for 3-5 minutes until it is warmed through. Do not let it come to a boil.
5. Serve
    Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed. Potato soup often needs a good amount of salt to make the flavors pop.
    Ladle the hot, thick soup into bowls. Serve as-is, or top with a classic combination of crispy bacon, shredded cheddar cheese, and fresh green onions.
