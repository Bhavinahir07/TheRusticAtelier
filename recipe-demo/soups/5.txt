For the Aromatic Base:
    1 tbsp olive oil
    2 tbsp unsalted butter
    1 large yellow onion, chopped
    2 large carrots, peeled and diced
    3 celery stalks, diced
    4 cloves garlic, minced
    1 tsp salt
    ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
For the Soup & Vegetables:
    2 medium Russet potatoes, peeled and diced into ½-inch cubes
    6 cups (approx. 1.5 liters) low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth
    1 (14.5-ounce / 411g) can diced tomatoes, undrained
    2-3 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried thyme)
    1 bay leaf
    1 cup fresh or frozen green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
    1 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels
    1 cup fresh or frozen peas
For Finishing:
    2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
    1 tsp lemon juice (optional, brightens the flavors)

1. Sauté the Aromatic Base (Mirepoix)
    In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and melt the butter over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes. The vegetables should become soft, sweet, and translucent.
    Comment: This is the most important flavor-building step. Don't rush it. You want to "sweat" the vegetables, not brown them.
    Add the minced garlic, 1 tsp of salt, and ½ tsp of pepper. Cook for 1-2 minutes more, until the garlic is fragrant.
2. Build the Soup Base
    Add the diced potatoes, the broth, the can of diced tomatoes (with their juices), the fresh thyme sprigs, and the bay leaf to the pot.
    Stir everything to combine. Increase the heat and bring the soup to a boil.
3. Simmer the Hardy Vegetables
    Once the soup is boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer gently for 15-20 minutes.
    This first simmer is to cook the potatoes and carrots until they are just almost tender.
4. Add the Tender Vegetables
    Uncover the pot and add the green beans, corn, and peas.
    Tip: Adding these vegetables near the end ensures they stay crisp-tender and retain their bright color. If you add them at the beginning, they will become overcooked and mushy.
    Stir to combine, and let the soup simmer, uncovered, for another 5-10 minutes, or until the green beans and peas are tender but still vibrant.
5. Finish and Serve
    Remove the pot from the heat. Fish out and discard the thyme stems and the bay leaf.
    Stir in the fresh chopped parsley and the optional teaspoon of lemon juice (this really brightens up all the vegetable flavors).
    Taste the soup one last time and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.
    Ladle the hot soup into bowls and serve immediately with crusty bread.
