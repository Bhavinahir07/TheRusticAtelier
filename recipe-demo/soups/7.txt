For the Meatballs (Polpettine):
    ½ lb (225g) ground pork
    ½ lb (225g) ground beef (or use all pork)
    ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
    ¼ cup plain breadcrumbs
    1 large egg, lightly beaten
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
    ½ tsp salt
    ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper
For the Soup:
    1 tbsp olive oil
    1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
    2 large carrots, finely diced
    2 celery stalks, finely diced
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    8 cups (approx. 2 liters) high-quality chicken broth (low sodium)
    1 bay leaf
    ½ cup dry small pasta (like acini di pepe, orzo, or stelline)
    1 head of escarole, roughly chopped (or 5 oz fresh spinach)
For Finishing:
    Extra grated Parmesan cheese, for serving
    Red pepper flakes (optional)

1. Prepare the Meatballs
    In a large bowl, add all the meatball ingredients: ground pork, ground beef, Parmesan, breadcrumbs, egg, minced garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper.
    Gently mix with your hands until just combined.
    Comment: Do not overwork the meat mixture. Overmixing will result in tough, dense meatballs. Mix only until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
2. Form the Meatballs
    Line a large plate or baking sheet with parchment paper.
    Take small portions of the meat mixture (about ½ to ¾ teaspoon) and roll them between your palms to form tiny meatballs, about ½-inch in diameter.
    Place the finished meatballs on the prepared sheet. You should have 50-60 small meatballs.
3. Sauté the Aromatic Base (Sofrito)
    In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery (the sofrito). Sauté, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes, until the vegetables are very soft and the onion is translucent.
    Add the 3 cloves of minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more until fragrant.
4. Build and Simmer the Broth
    Pour in the chicken broth and add the bay leaf.
    Increase the heat and bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to a steady, gentle simmer.
5. Cook the Meatballs and Pasta
    Carefully drop the tiny raw meatballs one by one into the simmering broth.
    Let them cook in the simmer for about 5-7 minutes. They will float to the top when they are mostly cooked through.
    Tip: Poaching the meatballs directly in the broth is the traditional method and adds a wonderful flavor to the soup.
    Stir in the small pasta (acini di pepe) and let it cook in the soup for the time specified on the package (usually 7-9 minutes).
6. Wilt the Greens and Finish
    Once the pasta is al dente, stir in the chopped escarole (or spinach).
    Let it simmer for just 2-3 minutes more, until the greens are wilted and tender.
    Remove the pot from the heat and discard the bay leaf.
7. Serve
    Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed (it may not need much salt due to the broth and Parmesan).
    Ladle the hot soup into bowls, making sure each bowl gets plenty of meatballs, vegetables, and pasta.
    Serve immediately, topped with a generous sprinkle of extra grated Parmesan cheese and a pinch of red pepper flakes, if desired.
