For the Soup Base:
    1 medium (3-4 lb / approx. 1.5kg) sugar pumpkin (or Kabocha squash)
    2 tbsp olive oil
    2 tbsp unsalted butter
    1 large yellow onion, chopped
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    4 cups (approx. 1 liter) low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth
    ½ tsp ground nutmeg (freshly grated is best)
    ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
    1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional, for depth)
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper
For Finishing & Garnish:
    ½ cup (120ml) heavy cream
    Toasted pumpkin seeds (pepitas)
    A swirl of extra cream or high-quality olive oil

1. Roast the Pumpkin
    Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    Carefully cut the pumpkin in half (from stem to base). Use a spoon to scoop out all the seeds and stringy pulp. (You can reserve the seeds to toast later).
    Brush the cut flesh of the pumpkin halves with the olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.
    Place the halves cut-side-down on the prepared baking sheet.
    Roast for 40-50 minutes, or until the skin is blistering and the flesh is completely tender when pierced with a fork.
    Comment: Roasting is the key to a deep, non-watery, caramelized pumpkin flavor. Do not skip or rush this step.
2. Sauté the Aromatics
    While the pumpkin roasts, melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion and a pinch of salt. Sauté, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes, until the onion is very soft and translucent.
    Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more until fragrant.
3. Build and Simmer the Soup
    Once the pumpkin is done roasting and is cool enough to handle, use a large spoon to scoop all the tender flesh out of the skin and add it directly to the pot with the onions.
    Add the broth, ground nutmeg, cinnamon, and the pinch of cayenne. Stir to combine.
    Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes to allow all the flavors to meld together.
4. Blend the Soup
    Remove the pot from the heat.
    Use an immersion blender to carefully blend the soup directly in the pot until it is completely smooth and velvety.
    Alternative Method: If using a stand blender, let the soup cool slightly. Working in batches, carefully transfer the soup to the blender. Vent the lid (remove the center cap and cover with a kitchen towel) and blend until smooth. Return the puréed soup to the pot.
5. Finish with Cream
    Place the pot of puréed soup back over low heat.
    Slowly stir in the heavy cream. Continue to heat the soup gently for 3-5 minutes until it is warmed through.
    Tip: Do not let the soup come to a boil after adding the cream, as this can cause the texture to break or curdle.
6. Serve
    Taste the soup one last time and adjust seasoning as needed (it may need more salt to enhance the pumpkin's sweetness).
    Ladle the hot, creamy soup into bowls. Garnish with a sprinkle of toasted pumpkin seeds, a small swirl of extra cream, and a dash of black pepper.
