For the Soup Base:
    2 tbsp unsalted butter (or olive oil)
    1 large yellow onion, roughly chopped
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1.5 lbs (approx. 680g) carrots, peeled and roughly chopped
    1 medium potato (like a Yukon Gold), peeled and roughly chopped (optional, for extra body)
For the Soup & Flavor:
    4 cups (approx. 1 liter) vegetable broth
    1 large bunch of fresh coriander (cilantro), stems and leaves separated
    1 pinch of ground cumin (optional, adds a subtle earthy warmth)
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper
For Finishing:
    2-4 tbsp heavy cream (optional, for richness)
    A squeeze of fresh lemon juice

1. Sauté the Aromatic Base
    In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion and a generous pinch of salt. Sauté, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes, until the onion is very soft, sweet, and translucent.
    Comment: This "sweating" step is key to building a sweet, non-bitter foundation. Do not let the onions brown.
    Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more until fragrant.
2. Build and Simmer the Soup
    Add the chopped carrots and the optional potato to the pot. Stir to coat them in the butter.
    Finely chop the stems from your bunch of coriander and add them to the pot (reserve the leaves for later). Add the optional pinch of ground cumin, if using. Sauté for 1-2 minutes more.
    Pour in the vegetable broth and season with a bit of black pepper.
    Increase the heat and bring the soup to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 20-25 minutes.
    The soup is ready for the next step when the carrots are completely tender and can be easily pierced with a fork.
3. Add Fresh Coriander and Blend
    Remove the pot from the heat.
    Add the reserved fresh coriander leaves to the pot (save a few small leaves for garnish, if you like).
    Use an immersion blender to carefully blend the soup directly in the pot until it is completely smooth and velvety.
    Alternative Method: If using a stand blender, let the soup cool slightly. Working in batches, add the soup and the fresh coriander leaves to the blender. Vent the lid (remove the center cap and cover with a kitchen towel) and blend until smooth. Return the puréed soup to the pot.
4. Finish the Soup
    Place the pot of puréed soup back over low heat.
    If you want a richer, more luxurious texture, stir in the optional heavy cream now.
    Stir in a small squeeze of lemon juice.
    Tip: The lemon juice is a crucial finishing touch. It brightens all the flavors and cuts through the sweetness of the carrots, making the coriander taste "greener" and more vibrant.
5. Serve
    Taste the soup one last time. Adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or another drop of lemon juice as needed.
    Ladle the hot, vibrant soup into bowls. Garnish with a small swirl of cream, a few reserved coriander leaves, and a final crack of black pepper.
