For the Soup Stock (Broth):
    2 lbs (900g) chicken wings or chicken backs (rich in gelatin and flavor)
    1 large onion, halved
    1 large carrot, roughly chopped
    1 head of garlic, halved horizontally
    1 piece fresh ginger (2-inch), sliced
    10 cups (2.5 liters) water
    1 sheet dried Kombu (kelp), approx 4x4 inches
For the Shoyu Tare (Seasoning Sauce):
    ½ cup (120ml) Soy Sauce (high quality)
    2 tbsp Mirin
    1 tbsp Sake
    1 tsp brown sugar
    1 clove garlic, smashed
    1 small piece dried Kombu
For the Toppings:
    Noodles: 4 servings fresh Ramen noodles (look for "alkaline" or "kansui" on the package)
    Chashu: 1 lb pork belly, braised (simmered in soy/sugar/ginger until tender)
    Ajitsuke Tamago: 4 soft-boiled eggs, marinated in soy/mirin
    Menma: Fermented bamboo shoots
    Scallions: Finely sliced
    Nori: Sheets of dried seaweed

1. Make the Soup Stock (The Body)
    In a large stockpot, combine the chicken wings (or backs), onion, carrot, garlic, ginger, and water.
    Bring to a boil over high heat. Skim off any gray scum that rises to the surface.
    Reduce heat to a very gentle simmer. Add the sheet of Kombu.
    Simmer gently for 3 to 4 hours. Do not boil hard, or the soup will become cloudy. You want a clear, golden broth.
    Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard the solids. Keep the broth piping hot.
2. Make the Tare (The Soul)
    In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake, brown sugar, garlic, and small piece of Kombu.
    Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Let it bubble gently for 5 minutes to concentrate the flavors and dissolve the sugar.
    Remove the garlic and kombu. This is your concentrated seasoning base.
3. Prepare the Toppings
    Chashu (Pork): Ideally, braise a block of pork belly in soy sauce, water, sugar, and ginger for 2 hours until tender, then slice. (You can also simply boil thin slices of pork belly in the broth for a quick version).
    Ajitama (Egg): Boil eggs for exactly 6 minutes and 30 seconds. Chill in ice water immediately. Peel and soak in a little soy sauce and water mixture for at least 1 hour.
4. Cook the Noodles
    Bring a large pot of unsalted water to a rolling boil.
    Loosen the fresh noodles and drop them in.
    Cook according to the package instructions (usually extremely fast, 60 to 90 seconds). They should be al dente (firm/chewy).
    Drain well, shaking off all excess water.
5. Assembly (The "Bowl Construction")
    The Tare: In the bottom of each deep serving bowl, pour about 2-3 tablespoons of the Tare.
    The Aroma Oil (Optional): If you have it, add 1 teaspoon of sesame oil or chicken fat (schmaltz) to the bowl.
    The Broth: Ladle the piping hot Chicken Stock (about 1.5 cups) into the bowl. The broth mixes with the tare to create the final soup flavor.
    The Noodles: Carefully slide the drained noodles into the soup. Use chopsticks to lift and fold them so they lay neatly ("noodle fold").
    The Toppings: Arrange the sliced Chashu pork, the halved soft-boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and nori sheet on top.
    Garnish: Finish with a generous mound of sliced scallions.
6. Serve
    Serve immediately. Ramen waits for no one. The noodles will continue to absorb broth and soften, so it must be eaten hot and fast!
