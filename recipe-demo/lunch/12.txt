For the Wrapper Dough (or use 1 pack store-bought "Dumpling" wrappers):
    3 cups (360g) all-purpose flour
    ¾ cup to 1 cup (180-240ml) cold water (adjust humidity dependent)
    ½ tsp salt
For the Filling:
    1 lb (450g) Ground Pork (fatty, at least 20% fat)
    ½ small head Napa Cabbage, finely minced
    2 stalks scallions, finely sliced
    1 tbsp fresh ginger, minced
    1 tbsp Soy Sauce
    1 tbsp Shaoxing Rice Wine (or dry sherry)
    ½ tsp white pepper powder
    1 tsp salt (for cabbage) + ½ tsp (for meat)
    1 tsp sugar
    2 tbsp Sesame Oil
    ¼ cup Chicken stock or water (for "beating" into the meat)
For the Dipping Sauce:
    2 tbsp Chinkiang Black Vinegar
    1 tbsp Soy Sauce
    1 tsp Chili Oil (optional)
    1 clove garlic, minced

1. Make the Dough (If from scratch)
    In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Slowly trickle in the cold water while stirring with chopsticks or a fork.
    Once a shaggy dough forms, knead it with your hands for 5-8 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.
    Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.
    Comment: Resting relaxes the gluten, making it possible to roll the wrappers thin without them shrinking back.
2. Prep the Cabbage (Crucial Step)
    Finely mince the Napa cabbage. Place it in a bowl and toss with 1 tsp of salt.
    Let it sit for 15 minutes. The salt will draw out the water.
    Take handfuls of the cabbage and squeeze incredibly hard to wring out all the liquid. Discard the liquid. Put the dry cabbage in a clean bowl.
3. Make the Meat Filling (The "Da Shui" Technique)
    In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, ginger, soy sauce, rice wine, white pepper, sugar, and ½ tsp salt.
    Technique: Pour in the ¼ cup of stock/water. Using chopsticks or your hand, stir the meat vigorously in one direction only.
    Keep stirring until the liquid is completely absorbed and the meat becomes a sticky, pale paste (about 3-5 minutes). This creates the "bouncy" texture.
    Finally, mix in the squeezed cabbage, scallions, and sesame oil. (The oil coats the meat and seals in the juices).
4. Roll the Wrappers
    Divide the rested dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a long log (snake). Cut the log into small pieces (about 12-15g each).
    Flatten each piece with your palm.
    Use a rolling pin to roll the edges of the dough thinner than the center. (The center needs to be thick to support the filling).
    Tip: Rotate the dough with one hand while rolling with the other.
5. Wrap the Dumplings
    Place a tablespoon of filling in the center of a wrapper.
    Fold the wrapper in half to create a half-moon. Pinch the center top together.
    Make pleats (folds) on the side facing you, pressing them into the back side to seal. (Or simply pinch the edges tightly shut if pleating is too hard).
    Ensure the dumpling is completely sealed; otherwise, it will fill with water during boiling.
6. Boil the Jiaozi (The "Three Boils" Method)
    Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
    Gently drop in about 15-20 dumplings. Stir gently with the back of a ladle to prevent sticking to the bottom.
    When the water returns to a full boil, add ½ cup of cold water.
    Wait for it to boil again. Add another ½ cup of cold water.
    Wait for it to boil a third time.
    Why? This lowers the temperature slightly, allowing the filling to cook through without the vigorous boiling water tearing the skin apart.
    The dumplings are done when they are puffed up and floating.
7. Serve
    Remove dumplings with a spider strainer or slotted spoon.
    Serve immediately with the Chinkiang vinegar dipping sauce.
