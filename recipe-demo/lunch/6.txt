For the Sushi Rice (Sumeshi):
    2 cups (300g) Japanese short-grain white rice (brands like Tamaki or Nishiki)
    2 cups (480ml) water (or slightly less, 1:1 ratio is standard for sushi)
    1 piece dried Kombu (kelp), approx 2x2 inches (optional, but recommended)
For the Sushi Vinegar (Sharizu):
    ½ cup (80ml) unseasoned rice vinegar
    2 tbsp granulated sugar
    1 tsp fine sea salt
For the Rolling & Filling:
    4-5 sheets Nori (roasted seaweed)
    Fillings (Your Choice):
        Sashimi-grade salmon or tuna, cut into long strips
        Cucumber, seeded and julienned (cut into thin strips)
        Crab stick (surimi)
        Soy sauce, pickled ginger (gari), and wasabi, for serving
Equipment:
    Bamboo rolling mat (makisu)

1. Wash the Rice (The Most Important Step)
    Place the rice in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Swirl your hand vigorously. The water will turn cloudy white.
    Drain the water. Repeat this process 3-5 times until the water runs almost completely clear.
    Comment: This removes excess starch. If you skip this, your sushi will be gummy and mushy instead of sticky and distinct.
    Drain the rice well in a sieve and let it sit for 15 minutes (optional, but helps even cooking).
2. Cook the Rice
    Place the drained rice and the 2 cups of water in a rice cooker (or heavy pot). Place the Kombu strip on top of the rice.
    Cook according to your rice cooker's "Sushi" or "White Rice" setting. (If using a pot: Bring to boil, cover, reduce heat to low, simmer 15 mins, remove from heat and steam 10 mins).
    Once cooked, discard the Kombu.
3. Make the Vinegar Seasoning (Sharizu)
    While the rice cooks, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl.
    Microwave for 30 seconds or heat gently on the stove just until the sugar and salt dissolve. Let it cool.
4. Season the Rice (Shari-kiri)
    Transfer the hot cooked rice into a large, wide bowl (traditionally a wooden hangiri, but a large glass bowl works).
    Pour the vinegar mixture evenly over the hot rice.
    Technique: Using a rice paddle or spatula, use a slicing motion to mix the rice. Do not mash or stir it. You want to separate the grains.
    Simultaneously, fan the rice (use a piece of cardboard or a fan) to cool it down quickly. This evaporation gives the rice its glossy shine.
    Cover with a damp towel to keep it warm (body temperature is ideal) while you prepare fillings.
5. Prepare the Rolling Station
    Wrap your bamboo mat (makisu) in plastic wrap (this keeps it clean and prevents sticking).
    Place a half-sheet of Nori on the mat, shiny side down. (You can use a full sheet for thick rolls, but half-sheets make standard rolls).
6. Spread the Rice
    Dip your fingers in a bowl of water (mixed with a splash of vinegar) to prevent sticking.
    Grab a handful of sushi rice (about a tennis ball size) and place it on the Nori.
    Gently spread the rice to cover the Nori, leaving a 1-inch border of empty Nori at the top edge.
    Tip: Don't squish the rice! Push it gently so it stays fluffy.
7. Fill and Roll
    Place your chosen fillings (fish, cucumber, avocado) in a horizontal line across the center of the rice.
    Lift the bottom edge of the bamboo mat (closest to you) and roll it up and over the fillings.
    Tuck the edge of the Nori tightly against the fillings, then continue rolling until the roll is closed.
    Give the mat a gentle squeeze to shape the roll (square or round).
8. Cut and Serve
    Transfer the roll to a cutting board.
    Dip a sharp knife into water (to prevent sticking).
    Slice the roll in half, then cut each half into 3 or 4 even pieces. Wipe and wet the knife between every cut.
    Arrange the pieces on a plate and serve immediately with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi.
