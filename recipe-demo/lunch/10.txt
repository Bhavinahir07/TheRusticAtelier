The Stew Base:
    1 lb (450g) Beef Chuck (cut into cubes) or Chicken Thighs
    2 large onions, sliced thinly (for caramelizing)
    1 large carrot, peeled and cut into chunks (Rangiri style/rolling cut)
    2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
    4 cups (960ml) water (or beef/chicken stock for extra depth)
    1 tbsp oil
The Curry Flavor:
    1 box (approx. 200g) Japanese Curry Roux (Golden Curry, Vermont Curry, or Java Curry)
    Kakushi-aji (Secret Flavors):
    1 tbsp Tomato Ketchup (for acidity)
    1 tbsp Worcestershire Sauce (for savoriness)
    ½ apple, grated (for sweetness and texture)
    1 small square dark chocolate (optional, for glossy color)
For Serving:
    Japanese Short-Grain Rice (steamed)
    Fukujinzuke (Red pickled radish) - The essential garnish

1. Caramelize the Onions (The Most Important Step)
    Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot (or Dutch oven) over medium heat.
    Add the sliced onions. Sauté them for 15-20 minutes, stirring frequently.
    Comment: You want them to turn soft, jammy, and light brown. This provides the deep, savory sweetness that defines good Japanese curry. Do not rush this.
2. Sear the Meat
    Push the onions to the side of the pot. Add the beef (or chicken) cubes.
    Sear the meat on all sides until browned. (You don't need to cook it through yet, just get some color).
3. Simmer the Broth
    Add the water (or stock) to the pot. Scrape the bottom of the pot to release any browned bits (fond).
    Bring to a boil. Skim off any foam/scum that rises to the top.
    Add the grated apple, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce.
    Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer.
        If using Beef: Simmer for 45 minutes until tender.
        If using Chicken: Simmer for 15 minutes.
4. Add the Root Vegetables
    Add the carrots and potatoes to the pot.
    Continue simmering for another 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.
    Tip: We add potatoes later so they don't disintegrate into the sauce during the long beef simmer.
5. The Roux (Thickening)
    Crucial Technique: Turn the heat OFF.
    Break the curry roux blocks into pieces and add them to the pot.
    Stir gently until the blocks are completely dissolved.
    Why turn off the heat? If the water is boiling, the starch in the roux can seize up, creating lumps. It dissolves best in hot, non-boiling liquid.
6. Final Simmer
    Turn the heat back on to low.
    Add the optional square of dark chocolate or a pat of butter.
    Simmer gently, uncovered, for 5-10 minutes. The curry will thicken significantly and become glossy. Stir often to prevent burning the bottom.
7. Serve
    Scoop a mound of hot Japanese rice onto one half of a plate.
    Ladle the thick curry sauce and vegetables generously over the other half (and a little over the rice).
    Garnish with a bright red pile of Fukujinzuke (pickles) to cut through the richness. Eat with a spoon!
