For the Waffle Dough:
    4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour
    ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar
    ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, melted
    2 tsp (7g) active dry yeast
    ¼ cup (60ml) warm milk (105°F / 40°C)
    1 large egg
    ½ tsp ground cinnamon
    ½ tsp salt
For the Stroop (Caramel Filling):
    1 cup (200g) brown sugar (packed)
    ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter
    ¼ cup (60ml) dark corn syrup, molasses, or Dutch keukenstroop
    1 tsp ground cinnamon
    1 tsp vanilla extract
Equipment Note: You need a shallow waffle cone maker, pizzelle iron, or a specific stroopwafel iron. A standard Belgian waffle iron is too deep and will not work.

1. Activate the Yeast
    In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk with a pinch of the sugar. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.
2. Make the Dough
    In a large bowl (or stand mixer), combine the flour, the rest of the sugar, melted butter, egg, cinnamon, and salt.
    Pour in the yeast mixture.
    Knead the dough for 2-3 minutes until it forms a smooth, stiff ball. It should feel like cookie dough, not batter.
    Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let the dough rise in a warm spot for 1 hour.
3. Make the Stroop (The Syrup)
    While the dough rises, make the filling. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the brown sugar, butter, syrup (or molasses), and cinnamon.
    Stir constantly until the sugar has dissolved and the butter is melted. Let it bubble gently for 2-3 minutes until it thickens slightly into a sauce.
    Remove from heat, stir in the vanilla, and keep warm (it must be warm to spread).
4. Press the Waffles
    Preheat your waffle iron.
    Divide the risen dough into small balls, about 1.5 inches in diameter (golf ball size).
    Place a dough ball in the center of the hot iron and press down firmly.
    Cook for about 60-90 seconds. The waffle should be golden brown but not dark.
5. The Surgery (Slice and Fill)
    Crucial Step: You must work fast. As soon as you remove the hot waffle from the iron, place it on a cutting board.
    While it is strictly hot, use a round cookie cutter to trim the rough edges (optional, for a perfect circle).
    The Slice: Place your hand flat on top of the waffle to hold it steady (use a towel if it's too hot). Using a sharp, thin serrated knife, carefully slice the waffle horizontally through the middle, splitting it into two thin disks.
    Warning: If the waffle cools, it will become brittle and shatter instead of slicing. You must do this immediately.
6. Sandwich
    Spread a generous tablespoon of the warm caramel syrup on the cut side of one disk.
    Place the other disk (cut side down) on top, sandwiching the caramel.
    Press them together gently.
7. Cool and Serve
    Let the stroopwafel cool on a wire rack. As it cools, the caramel will stiffen and glue the two halves together, and the cookie will turn from soft to crispy.
    Traditional Serving Method: Place the stroopwafel on top of a steaming mug of coffee or tea for 1-2 minutes. The steam warms the cookie and melts the caramel inside, making it gooey and delicious.
