The Tofu & Meat:
    1 block (approx. 14oz/400g) Silken or Soft Tofu, cut into 1-inch cubes
    4 oz (115g) Ground Pork or Ground Beef (Beef is traditional, pork is common)
    1 tsp Soy Sauce (for the meat)
    1 tsp cooking oil (for the meat)
The Aromatics & Sauce Base:
    2 ½ tbsp Pixian Doubanjiang (Broad Bean Paste), finely chopped if chunky
    1 tbsp Douchi (Fermented Black Beans), rinsed and roughly chopped
    1 tbsp Ginger, minced
    1 tbsp Garlic, minced
    1 tsp Chili Flakes (Korean Gochugaru works well for color)
    1 cup (240ml) Chicken stock or water
The Thickener & Seasoning:
    Slurry: 1 tbsp Cornstarch mixed with 2 tbsp water
    1 tsp Sugar
    1 tsp Light Soy Sauce
    Scallions (green parts only), finely sliced
The Finish (Crucial):
    1-2 tsp Sichuan Peppercorns, toasted and ground into powder (adjust for numbing preference)

1. Toast the Peppercorns
    In a dry wok or small pan over low heat, toast the whole Sichuan peppercorns for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
    Let them cool, then grind them into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder. Set aside. This is your finishing touch.
2. Blanch the Tofu (The Secret Technique)
    Bring a medium pot of water to a gentle boil. Add a generous pinch of salt.
    Gently slide the tofu cubes into the water. Let them steep in the barely simmering water for 2-3 minutes.
    Drain carefully and set aside.
    Comment: This step forces out excess water from the tofu, making it firmer and less likely to break later. The salt seasons the inside of the cubes.
3. Fry the Meat
    Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat with a little oil.
    Add the ground meat and stir-fry until it is crispy and browned.
    Add 1 tsp of soy sauce to the meat for color. Remove the meat from the pan and set aside (or push it to the very side if you have a large wok).
4. Fry the Red Oil Base
    Add 2 tbsp of oil to the pan over medium-low heat.
    Add the Pixian Doubanjiang. Stir-fry gently for 1-2 minutes until the oil turns a vibrant red color ("red oil").
    Add the chopped Douchi (black beans), ginger, garlic, and chili flakes. Stir-fry for another minute until incredibly fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.
5. Simmer
    Pour in the chicken stock (or water) and stir well.
    Add the sugar and light soy sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil.
    Slide the blanched tofu cubes gently into the sauce. Add the cooked meat back in.
    Reduce heat to a simmer. Let it bubble gently for 3-5 minutes so the tofu absorbs the flavors.
    Technique: Do not stir with a spoon, or you will break the tofu. Instead, shake the pan back and forth or gently push the back of your spatula/ladle to move things around.
6. Thicken the Sauce
    Give your cornstarch slurry a mix (starch settles).
    Pour about one-third of the slurry into the pan. Gently swirl the pan to mix. Wait 30 seconds.
    Pour in another third. Swirl again.
    Comment: Adding starch in batches ensures you don't get a gloopy mess. You want a glossy sauce that clings to the tofu, not a gelatinous block.
7. Finish and Serve
    Once the sauce is thick and glossy, remove from heat.
    Transfer to a serving bowl.
    Crucial Step: Generously sprinkle the Sichuan Peppercorn powder all over the top.
    Garnish with the green scallions.
    Serve immediately with steaming white rice. The numbing sensation hits you first, followed by the savory heat!
