The Cabbage:
    2 heads (approx. 5-6 lbs / 2.5kg) Napa Cabbage
    1 cup (approx. 250g) Coarse Sea Salt (Korean brine salt is best)
    water
The Porridge (Chapssal-pul):
    2 tbsp Sweet Rice Flour (Glutinous Rice Flour)
    1 cup (240ml) Water
    1 tbsp Sugar (helps fermentation)
The Seasoning Paste (Yangnyeom):
    ½ cup (120ml) Fish Sauce (Anchovy or Sand Lance)
    ¼ cup (approx. 50g) Saeujeot (Salted Fermented Shrimp), minced
    1-2 cups (100-200g) Gochugaru (Korean Red Chili Flakes) - adjust to spice preference
    1 cup Garlic cloves, minced
    1 tbsp Ginger, minced
    1 medium Onion, grated or blended
    ½ Asian Pear (or Apple), grated (adds sweetness to balance the salt)
The Vegetables:
    1 lb (450g) Korean Radish (Mu) or Daikon, julienned into matchsticks
    1 bunch Scallions (green onions), cut into 2-inch pieces
    1 bunch Mustard Greens (Gat) or Asian Chives (Buchu), optional, cut into 2-inch pieces

1. Cut and Salt the Cabbage (The Most Important Step)
    Cut: Make a slit through the core of the cabbage base (about 3 inches up). Gently pull the cabbage apart with your hands to tear it in half. (Do not cut through the leaves with a knife, or you'll have shredded bits). Repeat to make quarters.
    Wet: Dip the cabbage quarters quickly in a basin of water.
    Salt: Generously sprinkle the coarse salt between every single leaf, concentrating on the thick white stems. The leaves need less salt.
    Rest: Place the salted cabbage in a large basin. Let it sit for 6 to 8 hours. Turn the cabbages over every 2 hours so they salt evenly.
    Check: The cabbage is ready when the thick white stem is bendable and rubbery. If it snaps, it needs more time.
2. Rinse and Drain
    Rinse the salted cabbage in cold water 3 times to remove excess salt and dirt.
    Place in a colander and let drain for at least 1 hour. Squeeze gently to remove trapped water. (Too much water = watery kimchi).
3. Make the Porridge
    In a small pot, mix the sweet rice flour and water. Simmer over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it bubbles and thickens into a translucent glue (about 5 minutes).
    Stir in the sugar. Remove from heat and let it cool completely.
4. Make the Kimchi Paste
    In a large bowl, mix the cooled porridge with the fish sauce, minced salted shrimp (saeujeot), grated onion, ginger, garlic, and grated pear.
    Stir in the Gochugaru (chili flakes). Let the paste sit for 15 minutes so the flakes absorb the liquid and expand.
    Add the julienned radish, scallions, and mustard greens/chives. Toss well to coat the vegetables in the red paste.
5. Stuff the Kimchi (Sok putting)
    Put on kitchen gloves (highly recommended to prevent chili burn).
    Take one cabbage quarter. Spread the radish-chili paste over each leaf, one by one. You don't need to pack it thick, just smear it to coat.
    Focus on the white stems.
    Fold the leaf part over towards the stem to create a neat packet. Wrap the outermost leaf around the whole bundle to hold it tight.
6. Ferment
    Pack the kimchi bundles into a glass jar or specialized kimchi container. Press down hard to remove air pockets.
    Leave about 1-2 inches of headspace at the top (it will bubble and rise as it ferments).
    Room Temp: Let the jar sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 days. You will see bubbles rising, and it will start to smell sour.
    Fridge: Move the jar to the refrigerator.
    Note: You can eat it fresh (Geotjeori style), but the flavor is best after fermenting slowly in the fridge for about 2 weeks.
7. Serve
    To serve, remove a bundle. Use kitchen scissors to cut it crosswise into bite-sized pieces.
    Serve as a side dish (banchan) or use aged kimchi for Kimchi Stew (Jjigae).
