For the Pastry Shells:
    1 sheet (approx. 250g-300g) all-butter puff pastry, thawed if frozen (store-bought is perfectly acceptable if high quality)
    Unsalted butter, melted (for brushing, if the pastry isn't buttery enough)
For the Custard Filling:
    Part A (The Thickener):
        ⅓ cup (40g) all-purpose flour
        ¼ cup (60ml) milk (taken from the total amount below)
    Part B (The Milk Base):
        1 cup (240ml) whole milk
        1 wide strip of fresh lemon peel (pith removed)
        1 cinnamon stick
    Part C (The Syrup):
        1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
        ½ cup (120ml) water
    Part D (The Yolks):
        6 large egg yolks (save whites for another use)
Garnish:
    Ground cinnamon
    Powdered sugar

1. Prepare the Pastry Log (The Spiral Technique)
    Unroll your puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface.
    Authentic Step: If your pastry feels dry, brush it lightly with melted butter. Roll the sheet up tightly from the short edge into a dense log (like a Swiss roll).
    Trim the uneven ends. Cut the log into 12 even discs, each about ¾-inch (2cm) thick.
    Place the discs in a 12-cup muffin tin (or authentic nata tins if you have them).
    The Thumb Press: Dip your thumbs in cold water. Press into the center of the spiral and push the dough flat against the bottom and up the sides of the cup. The dough should be slightly thicker at the rim.
    Chill the tin in the fridge while you make the custard. Cold dough hits hot oven = crisp layers.
2. Make the Milk Base
    In a small bowl, whisk the flour with the ¼ cup of milk until smooth (no lumps).
    In a saucepan, bring the remaining 1 cup of milk, the lemon peel, and the cinnamon stick to a simmer.
    Once bubbling, pour in the flour mixture while whisking constantly. Cook for 1-2 minutes until it thickens into a paste. Remove from heat.
3. Make the Sugar Syrup
    In a separate small saucepan, combine the sugar and water.
    Bring to a boil without stirring. Let it boil until it reaches a temperature of 220°F (104°C) or until large, shiny bubbles form (about 3-4 minutes).
    Technique: Remove the cinnamon and lemon from the milk paste. Slowly pour the hot sugar syrup into the milk paste in a thin stream, whisking constantly to combine.
    Let this base cool for at least 10 minutes. (If it's too hot, it will scramble the eggs).
4. Finish the Custard
    Once the base is warm (not hot), whisk in the 6 egg yolks until the custard is smooth and glossy yellow. Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any cooked egg bits or lumps.
5. Bake at High Heat
    Preheat your oven to its maximum temperature (usually 500°F/260°C or 550°F/290°C). If you have a convection/fan setting, use it.
    Pour the custard into the chilled pastry shells, filling them about ¾ full (do not overfill, or they will bubble over).
    Bake for 10-12 minutes. Watch closely.
    The Goal: The pastry edges should be deep golden brown, and the custard tops should be bubbling and have distinctive dark brown/black blistered spots. Do not fear the burn spots; they are the flavor!
6. Serve
    Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes.
    Transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm, ideally dusted generously with cinnamon and powdered sugar, just like in Lisbon.
