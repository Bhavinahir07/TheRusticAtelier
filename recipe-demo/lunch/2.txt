For the Broth & Meat:
    1.5 lbs (700g) beef chuck or beef shank (bone-in is best for flavor), cut into chunks
    8-10 cups (2 - 2.5 liters) cold water
    1 bay leaf
    Salt and black peppercorns
For the Vegetables:
    2 medium beets, peeled and grated (julienned)
    1 large carrot, peeled and grated
    1 medium onion, finely diced
    3 medium potatoes, peeled and diced into cubes
    ½ head of small cabbage, shredded thinly
    2 tbsp vegetable oil (for sautéing)
For the Flavor Base (The Zazharka):
    2 tbsp tomato paste
    1 tbsp lemon juice (or white vinegar) – Crucial for color
    1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance the acid)
    2 cloves garlic, minced (added at the very end)
For Serving:
    Sour cream (Smetana)
    Fresh dill, chopped
    Rye bread

1. Make the Meat Broth
    Place the beef chunks and cold water in a large soup pot.
    Bring to a boil over high heat. As it boils, gray foam ("scum") will rise to the top. Skim this off carefully with a spoon to ensure a clear broth.
    Add the bay leaf and peppercorns. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the meat is tender.
2. Make the Zazharka (The Beet Base)
    While the broth simmers, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
    Add the diced onions and grated carrots. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until soft.
    Add the grated beets to the skillet. Cook for another 5 minutes.
    Crucial Step: Stir in the tomato paste, lemon juice (or vinegar), and sugar. Stir well to coat the vegetables.
    Add a ladle (about ½ cup) of the hot beef broth from the main pot into the skillet. Cover the skillet and let the beets braise on low heat for 10 minutes.
    Comment: The acid (lemon/vinegar) locks in the red color, preventing the soup from turning brown.
3. Cook the Potatoes and Cabbage
    Once the beef in the main pot is tender, add the cubed potatoes. Cook for 10 minutes.
    Add the shredded cabbage and cook for another 5 minutes. (The cabbage should be tender but still have a slight crunch, not mushy).
4. Combine and Finish
    Pour the entire contents of the skillet (the beet zazharka) into the main soup pot. Stir well. The soup will instantly turn a brilliant ruby red.
    Add the minced garlic now.
    Simmer everything together for just 5 more minutes to let the flavors meld.
    Taste and adjust: Borscht should be savory, sweet, and slightly sour. Add more salt, pepper, or lemon juice if needed.
5. The Final Rest
    Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in a handful of fresh chopped dill.
    Tip: Let the soup rest, covered, for at least 15-20 minutes before serving. Borscht is famously better the next day, but this short rest allows the flavors to penetrate the vegetables.
6. Serve
    Ladle the hot, red soup into bowls, ensuring everyone gets a piece of meat.
    Top with a generous dollop of cold sour cream and extra fresh dill. Serve with dark rye bread.
