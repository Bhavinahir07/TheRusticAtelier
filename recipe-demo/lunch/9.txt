The Foundation:
    2 cups (300g) Japanese short-grain white rice (uncooked)
    2 ½ cups water (standard ratio, or follow your rice cooker)
    4-5 sheets Nori (roasted seaweed), cut into thirds strips
    Salt (Sea salt is best)
Classic Filling Options (Choose 1 or mix):
    Sha-ke (Salted Salmon): ½ cup cooked salmon flakes mixed with a pinch of salt.
    Umeboshi (Pickled Plum): 3-4 plums, pitted and mashed (for a tart, salty kick).
    Tuna Mayo: 1 small can of tuna (drained) mixed with 1 tbsp Japanese mayonnaise (Kewpie) and 1 tsp soy sauce.
    Okaka: Bonito flakes mixed with soy sauce.
Station Setup:
    A bowl of water
    A small bowl of salt

1. Cook the Rice
    Wash the rice until the water runs clear (just like for sushi).
    Cook the rice in a rice cooker or on the stove.
    Crucial Step: The rice must be used while it is freshly cooked and hot. Do not let it cool down, or it won't stick together. Use a rice paddle to fluff it up as soon as it's done.
2. Prepare the "Te-shio" (Hand Salt) Station
    Onigiri is messy work. Set up a bowl of clean drinking water and a small bowl of salt next to your workspace.
    Cut your Nori sheets into strips (usually thirds).
3. The Scoop
    Wet your hands thoroughly in the water bowl.
    Dip two fingers into the salt bowl and rub the salt over your wet palms.
    Comment: This salt layer is the primary seasoning for the rice. Be generous!
    Scoop a handful of hot rice (about ½ cup) into one hand.
    Tip: If the rice is too hot to handle, you can briefly toss it between your hands to cool the surface, or use a small bowl to scoop it first.
4. Fill the Center
    Flatten the rice in your palm slightly and make a small indentation in the center.
    Place about 1 teaspoon of your chosen filling (Salmon, Umeboshi, or Tuna Mayo) into the indentation.
    Gently fold the rice over the filling to enclose it completely. If needed, add a tiny bit more rice on top to cover the "hole."
5. Shape the Triangle
    This requires a specific hand motion.
    Cup your bottom hand to hold the base of the rice.
    Form your top hand into a "roof" shape (a V-shape).
    Gently press and rotate the rice ball, turning it three times to form a triangle.
    Technique: Use just enough pressure to make the rice stick together, but do not squish it. You want the grains to remain fluffy, not mashed into a paste.
6. Wrap the Nori
    Style A (Crispy): Wrap the nori strip around the bottom of the triangle right before eating.
    Style B (Soft/Combini): Wrap the nori strip around the rice ball immediately while the rice is hot. The steam will soften the seaweed, making it cling to the rice (this is the classic lunchbox style).
7. Serve
    Place the Onigiri on a plate or pack into a bento box.
    Often, a small bit of the ingredient is placed on the very top tip of the triangle so you know which filling is inside.
    Serve at room temperature (Onigiri is meant to be eaten cool or slightly warm, never cold from the fridge as the rice hardens).
