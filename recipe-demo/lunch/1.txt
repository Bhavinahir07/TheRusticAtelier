For the Chicken & Pasta:
    1 lb (450g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1-inch bite-sized pieces
    12 oz (340g) short pasta (Penne, Fusilli, or Farfalle hold the sauce best)
    1 tbsp olive oil (for searing)
    1 tsp salt
    ½ tsp black pepper
    ½ tsp garlic powder (for the chicken)
For the Sauce (Pesto):
    ½ cup (approx. 1 jar) high-quality Basil Pesto (homemade or store-bought)
    Crucial: ½ cup reserved starchy pasta water
    ¼ cup heavy cream (optional, for a "creamy pesto" variation)
For Finishing:
    ½ cup cherry tomatoes, halved (adds acidity to cut the rich oil)
    Freshly grated Parmesan cheese
    Toasted pine nuts (optional)

1. Boil the Water and Cook Pasta
    Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.
    Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente (firm to the bite).
    Crucial Step: Before draining, carefully dip a mug into the pot and scoop out about 1 cup of the starchy cooking water. You will need this liquid gold later. Drain the pasta.
2. Sear the Chicken
    While the pasta boils, season the chicken pieces generously with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
    Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
    Add the chicken in a single layer. Cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes to get a golden sear. Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes until cooked through.
    Comment: Do not boil the chicken in the sauce! Searing it first creates texture and flavor.
3. The Assembly (Off Heat)
    Turn the heat under the skillet down to very low (or turn it off completely if your stove is electric and stays hot).
    Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the cooked chicken.
    Pour in the Pesto and the halved cherry tomatoes.
    Technique: Pour in about ¼ cup of the reserved hot pasta water (and the heavy cream, if using).
4. Toss and Emulsify
    Vigorously toss and stir the pasta, chicken, and sauce together.
    The hot pasta water will mix with the oil in the pesto and the starch from the pasta to create a creamy, glossy sauce that clings to every noodle.
    If it looks dry or "clumpy," add more pasta water, a splash at a time, until it looks silky.
    Tip: Remember, we are doing this off high heat to keep the basil bright green and fresh.
5. Serve
    Taste and adjust salt if needed (parmesan in the pesto is salty, so taste first).
    Serve immediately, topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and toasted pine nuts.
