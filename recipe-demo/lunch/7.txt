For the Udon Broth (Kakejiru):
    4 cups (960ml) water
    1 piece dried Kombu (kelp), approx 4x4 inches
    1 cup loose Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)
    2 tbsp soy sauce (Usukuchi/Light Soy Sauce is traditional for color, but regular works)
    1 tbsp Mirin (sweet rice wine)
    1 tsp sugar (optional, adjust to taste)
    ½ tsp salt (crucial for the Kansai style)
For the Noodles & Toppings:
    2 bricks Frozen Sanuki Udon (found in the freezer aisle of Asian markets)
    2 stalks scallions (green onions), finely sliced
    Kamaboko (pink and white fish cake), sliced
    Tenkasu (crunchy tempura bits), optional
    Shichimi Togarashi (Japanese 7-spice blend), for serving

1. Make the Dashi (The Foundation)
    Cold Brew Method (Best): Soak the Kombu in the 4 cups of water for at least 30 minutes (or overnight).
    Cooking: Pour the water and Kombu into a pot. Turn heat to medium-low.
    Crucial Step: Just before the water comes to a full boil, remove the Kombu. If you boil the kelp, the stock will become slimy and bitter.
    Add the Katsuobushi (bonito flakes) to the hot water. Let it boil gently for exactly 60 seconds, then turn off the heat. Let the flakes sink to the bottom (about 2-3 minutes).
    Strain the golden liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard the solids. You now have Ichiban Dashi.
2. Season the Broth (Kakejiru)
    Return the clear dashi to the pot over medium heat.
    Add the soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and salt.
    Taste the broth. It should be savory, smoky, and slightly salty. It needs to be a bit strong to flavor the thick noodles. Adjust with more salt or soy sauce if needed.
    Keep the broth piping hot, but do not let it boil vigorously (which clouds the soup).
3. Prepare the Noodles
    Bring a separate large pot of water to a rolling boil.
    Drop in the frozen udon bricks.
    Technique: Do not force them apart. Let them loosen naturally in the hot water. This usually takes only 60-90 seconds.
    Once they separate and float, test one strand. It should be hot and chewy. Drain immediately.
    Tip: Unlike cold udon (Zaru Udon), you do not rinse these under cold water. Shake off the excess hot water and place them directly into serving bowls.
4. Assemble and Serve
    Pour the piping hot broth over the noodles in the bowls.
    Top with the Kamaboko slices, a generous mound of green onions, and a sprinkle of Tenkasu (tempura bits) for texture.
    Serve immediately with a dash of Shichimi Togarashi spice on top.
