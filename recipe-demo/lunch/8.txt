The Fish (Must be "Sashimi-Grade"):
    Maguro: ¼ lb (115g) Lean Bluefin or Yellowfin Tuna block (saku)
    Sake: ¼ lb (115g) Fatty Salmon block (saku)
    Hamachi: ¼ lb (115g) Yellowtail block (saku)
    Hotate: 3-4 raw Scallops (optional)
The Garnish (Tsuma):
    4 inches Daikon radish, peeled and shredded into threads (essential for digestion and palate cleansing)
    4-5 fresh Shiso leaves (perilla)
    Lemon slices
The Dip:
    High-quality Soy Sauce (Shoyu)
    Fresh Grated Wasabi (or high-quality paste)
    Pickled Ginger (Gari)
Equipment:
    A very sharp knife (Yanagiba is traditional, but a sharp Chef’s knife works)
    Clean cutting board

1. Safety and Temperature Control
    Keep the fish in the refrigerator until the very last second.
    Ensure your hands, knife, and cutting board are impeccably clean.
    Tip: Professional chefs often wipe their knife with a damp cloth dipped in vinegar water between cuts to sterilize and prevent sticking.
2. Prepare the Garnish (Tsuma)
    Peel the Daikon radish. Using a spiralizer, mandoline, or very steady knife skills, cut it into fine, noodle-like threads.
    Soak these threads in ice water for 5 minutes to make them crisp, then drain well.
    Arrange a mound of daikon and the Shiso leaves on your serving plate before you start cutting the fish.
3. Trimming the Blocks (Saku)
    Place your fish block on the board. Identify the direction of the grain (the white lines).
    Trim off any uneven edges to create a neat rectangular shape (you can eat the trimmings as a snack or use in spicy tuna rolls).
4. The Cut: Hira-Zukuri (Rectangular Slice)
    This is the standard cut for Tuna and Salmon.
    Position the knife blade at a 90-degree angle to the grain of the fish.
    Start the cut with the heel of the knife blade resting on the fish.
    The Technique: Pull the knife back toward you in one long, fluid motion. Do not saw back and forth. Use the entire length of the blade, finishing the cut with the very tip.
    The slice should be about ¼ inch (0.5 cm) thick.
    Repeat, laying each slice gently to the side.
5. The Cut: Usu-Zukuri (Thin Slice - for White Fish/Hamachi)
    For firmer fish like Yellowtail or Flounder, thinner slices are better.
    Angle your knife blade to about 45 degrees.
    Use the same "pulling" motion, but cut extremely thin, almost translucent slices on the bias (diagonal).
6. Plating and Serving
    Using chopsticks (or clean hands), gently lift the slices and fan them out over the Shiso leaves and Daikon mound.
    Arrangement: Traditionally, lean fish (tuna) is placed towards the back/left, and fatty/light fish (salmon/white fish) towards the front/right.
    Serve immediately with a small dish of soy sauce and a dollop of wasabi.
    How to Eat: Put a tiny bit of wasabi directly on the fish, then dip the fish lightly in the soy sauce. Do not mix the wasabi into the soy sauce soup-style!
