For the cake batter:
    2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
    2 ½ tsp baking powder
    ½ tsp salt
    ¾ cup unsalted butter (softened to room temperature)
    2 cups granulated sugar
    4 large eggs (room temperature)
    1 tbsp pure vanilla extract
    1 cup whole milk (room temperature)

For the vanilla buttercream frosting:
    1 cup unsalted butter (softened)
    4 cups powdered sugar (sifted)
    2 tsp pure vanilla extract
    2–4 tbsp heavy cream or milk (to adjust consistency)
    Pinch of salt

1. Preheat oven and prepare pans
    Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
    Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans (or line with parchment).
    Tip: Parchment ensures easy cake release and avoids tearing.
2. Mix the dry ingredients
    In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
    Set aside.
3. Cream the butter and sugar
    In a large mixing bowl, beat softened butter and sugar together for 2–3 minutes until light and fluffy.
    Comment: Creaming incorporates air, which gives the cake a tender crumb.
4. Add eggs and vanilla
    Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
    Mix in vanilla extract.
    Tip: Room temperature eggs blend better and prevent curdling.
5. Alternate adding dry ingredients and milk
    Add one-third of the dry mixture, then half the milk, mixing on low speed.
    Repeat, ending with the dry mixture.
    Mix until just combined (do not overmix).
    Comment: Overmixing develops gluten and can make cake dense.
6. Bake the cakes
    Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.
    Smooth tops with a spatula.
    Bake for 30–35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
    Cool in pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
    Tip: Don’t frost warm cakes; it melts the buttercream.
7. Make the frosting
    Beat butter until creamy.
    Add powdered sugar gradually, then vanilla, salt, and cream.
    Beat for 3–4 minutes until fluffy.
    Tip: Adjust cream for thicker or lighter consistency.
8. Assemble the cake
    Place one cake layer on a serving plate.
    Spread frosting evenly over top.
    Place second layer on top and frost the whole cake.
    Decorate with sprinkles, berries, or piping if desired.
    Tip: Chill for 20 minutes before slicing for neat, clean layers.
