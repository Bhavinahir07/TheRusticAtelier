For the brown sugar butter cake:
    3 cups all-purpose flour
    2 tsp baking powder
    ½ tsp salt
    1 cup unsalted butter (softened to room temperature)
    2 cups packed light brown sugar
    4 large eggs (room temperature)
    1 cup buttermilk (room temperature)
    2 tsp vanilla extract
For the homemade caramel frosting:
    1 ½ cups granulated sugar
    ½ cup water
    1 cup heavy cream (warmed)
    6 tbsp unsalted butter (cut into pieces)
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    ¼ tsp salt
    3–4 cups powdered sugar (sifted)

1. Initial Oven and Pan Prep

    Arrange an oven rack in the center and preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

    Prepare two 9-inch round cake pans by buttering them, lining the bottoms with parchment paper circles, and then buttering the parchment. Flour the pans and tap out any excess.

2. Combine the Dry Staples

    In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. This step ensures the leavening is evenly distributed for a consistent rise.

3. Create the Cake's Foundation

    In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the softened butter and packed brown sugar together on medium-high for about 4 minutes. The goal is a noticeably lighter, aerated mixture.

    Comment: Using brown sugar as the base gives the cake layers a subtle molasses note that builds a deeper caramel flavor profile.

4. Incorporate Eggs and Vanilla

    Add the room temperature eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition until it is fully blended into the batter.

    Beat in the vanilla extract.

5. Build the Final Batter Structure

    With your mixer on its lowest setting, add the dry ingredient mixture in three additions, alternating with the buttermilk in two additions.

    Begin and end this process with the dry ingredients. Mix only until the last bit of flour just disappears into the batter. A smooth, uniform batter is the goal, not an over-mixed one.

6. Bake the Cake Layers

    Distribute the batter evenly between your two prepared pans.

    Bake for 30–35 minutes. A wooden skewer inserted into the center of a cake should come out clean.

    Let the cake layers cool in their pans on a wire rack for 20 minutes before turning them out to cool completely.

7. Craft the Caramel Base for the Frosting

    In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the granulated sugar and water. Stir just until the sugar is wet.

    Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Do not stir. Let it boil until it turns a medium amber color, swirling the pan occasionally for even cooking.

    Tip: Watch the caramel constantly, as it can go from perfect to burnt in seconds. Remove it from the heat as soon as it reaches the color of a copper penny.

    Once amber, immediately and carefully pour in the warm heavy cream. The mixture will bubble up violently. Whisk vigorously until smooth, then whisk in the butter, vanilla, and salt.

    Pour the caramel into a heatproof bowl and let it cool to room temperature.

8. Finish the Caramel Frosting

    Once the caramel sauce is completely cool, begin adding the sifted powdered sugar to the bowl, one cup at a time, beating with an electric mixer on low speed.

    Once all the sugar is incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and whip for 2-3 minutes until the frosting is smooth, creamy, and holds its shape.

    Comment: If the frosting is too thick, add a tablespoon of milk or cream. If it's too thin, add more powdered sugar.

9. Assemble the Caramel Cake

    Place one cooled cake layer on your serving plate.

    Spread about one-third of the caramel frosting over the top.

    Position the second layer on top. Use the remaining frosting to cover the top and sides of the cake, making smooth or decorative swirls with an offset spatula.

    Tip: This frosting sets up as it cools. For the cleanest slices, let the finished cake rest for about 30 minutes before serving.
