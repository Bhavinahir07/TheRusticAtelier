For the chocolate sponge cake:
    1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
    ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
    2 cups granulated sugar
    1 ½ tsp baking powder
    ½ tsp baking soda
    ½ tsp salt
    4 large eggs (room temperature)
    1 cup buttermilk (room temperature)
    ½ cup vegetable oil
    2 tsp vanilla extract
    1 cup hot coffee (enhances chocolate flavor)
For the cherry filling:
    2 cups pitted dark cherries (fresh or canned)
    ½ cup cherry juice (from canned cherries or cherry syrup)
    3 tbsp sugar
    2 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 2 tbsp cold water
For the whipped cream frosting:
    2 cups heavy cream (chilled)
    ½ cup powdered sugar
    1 tsp vanilla extract
For garnish:
    ½ cup chocolate shavings or curls
    Whole cherries (fresh or maraschino)

1. Prepare the cake pans and oven
    Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
    Grease and line two 9-inch round pans with parchment paper.
2. Mix dry ingredients
    In a large bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
    Whisk in the sugar.
3. Mix wet ingredients
    In another bowl, whisk together eggs, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla extract until smooth.
4. Combine wet and dry mixtures
    Add wet ingredients to dry and mix until combined.
    Slowly pour in hot coffee, mixing on low speed (batter will be thin).
    Tip: Don’t overmix; just blend until smooth.
5. Bake the cakes
    Divide batter evenly between pans.
    Bake 35–40 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs.
    Cool in pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
6. Prepare cherry filling
    In a saucepan, combine cherries, cherry juice, and sugar.
    Bring to a simmer, then stir in cornstarch mixture.
    Cook until thickened and glossy.
    Cool before using.
    Comment: This prevents filling from being runny when layered.
7. Make whipped cream frosting
    Beat chilled heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla until stiff peaks form.
    Tip: Chill bowl and beaters beforehand for best results.
8. Assemble the cake
    Slice each cooled cake in half horizontally (for 4 layers total).
    Place one layer on a serving plate. Spread whipped cream, then cherry filling.
    Repeat with remaining layers.
    Frost entire cake with whipped cream.
9. Decorate
    Sprinkle with chocolate shavings/curls.
    Top with whole cherries for garnish.
    Tip: Chill the cake for at least 30 minutes before slicing — this helps the layers set firmly.
