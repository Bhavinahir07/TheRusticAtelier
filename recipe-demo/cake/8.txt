For the banana cake:
    2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
    1 tsp baking soda
    1 tsp baking powder
    ½ tsp salt
    1 tsp ground cinnamon
    ½ cup unsalted butter (softened to room temperature)
    ¾ cup granulated sugar
    ½ cup packed light brown sugar
    2 large eggs (room temperature)
    ½ cup buttermilk (room temperature)
    1 ½ cups mashed very ripe bananas (about 3-4 bananas)
    1 tsp vanilla extract
For the cream cheese frosting:
    8 oz block cream cheese (softened)
    ½ cup unsalted butter (softened)
    3–4 cups powdered sugar (sifted)
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    Pinch of salt

1. Prepare pans and oven
    Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
    Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.
2. Mix dry ingredients
    In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.
    Set aside.
3. Cream butter and sugars
    In a large bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).
    Comment: This step incorporates air into the batter, which creates a lighter, more tender cake.
4. Add eggs and wet ingredients
    Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each.
    Beat in the buttermilk, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract. The mixture may look slightly curdled.
    Tip: Using room temperature eggs and buttermilk helps the batter mix together smoothly.
5. Combine wet and dry mixtures
    Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed just until combined.
    Tip: Be careful not to overmix; this can make the cake tough. A few streaks of flour are okay.
6. Bake the cake
    Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.
    Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
    Let the cake cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.
    Comment: Frosting a warm cake will cause the frosting to melt, so ensure it's fully cooled.
7. Make the cream cheese frosting
    In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy.
    Gradually beat in the powdered sugar until combined. Add the vanilla and salt.
    Beat on high speed for 2 minutes until light and fluffy.
    Tip: If the frosting is too thin, add more powdered sugar. If it's too thick, add a splash of milk.
8. Assemble the cake
    Once the cake is completely cool, spread the frosting evenly over the top.
    Slice and serve.
    Tip: For cleaner slices, chill the frosted cake in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes before cutting.
