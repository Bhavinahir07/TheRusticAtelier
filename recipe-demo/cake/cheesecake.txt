For the Crust
    1 ½ cups (150 g) graham cracker crumbs (or digestive biscuits)
    ¼ cup (50 g) granulated sugar
    ½ cup (115 g) unsalted butter, melted (holds the crust together)
For the Cheesecake Filling
    4 (8 oz / 225 g each) packages cream cheese, softened (must be room temp for smooth texture)
    1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar
    1 cup (240 g) sour cream (adds tang and creaminess)
    4 large eggs, room temperature
    2 tsp vanilla extract
    2 tbsp all-purpose flour (helps stabilize the filling and reduce cracks)
    2 tsp lemon juice (balances sweetness, optional but recommended)
    Zest of 1 lemon (optional, adds freshness)
For the Sour Cream Topping (Optional but classic)
    1 cup (240 g) sour cream
    2 tbsp powdered sugar
    ½ tsp vanilla extract

1. Prepare the Pan
    Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C).
    Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.
    (Tip: A springform pan is essential for easy release. Wrapping the outside with foil prevents leaks in the water bath.)

2. Make the Crust
    Mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter until evenly coated.
    Press firmly into the bottom of the pan, using the back of a spoon or flat glass.
    Bake for 8–10 minutes until lightly golden. Remove and cool slightly.
    (Comment: Pre-baking ensures a crisp crust that won’t get soggy under the filling.)

3. Prepare the Filling
    In a large bowl, beat softened cream cheese with a mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy (about 2–3 minutes).
    Add sugar and flour, mix until blended.
    Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed.
    (Important: Do not overmix—excess air causes cracks when baking.)
    Stir in sour cream, vanilla, lemon juice, and zest until just combined.

4. Assemble Cheesecake
    Pour filling into the cooled crust and smooth the top.
    Place pan inside a larger roasting pan. Add hot water to the outer pan (about halfway up the springform).
    (Tip: The water bath keeps baking gentle, preventing cracks and keeping texture silky.)

5. Bake
    Bake for 55–70 minutes, until edges are set but the center still has a slight wobble.
    Turn off oven, crack the door open slightly, and let cheesecake cool inside for 1 hour.
    (Comment: Slow cooling prevents sudden temperature changes, reducing cracks.)

6. Add Sour Cream Topping (Optional)
    Mix sour cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Spread over cheesecake while still slightly warm.
    Bake another 10 minutes at 325°F (163°C).
    (Tip: This creates a smooth bakery-style finish.)

7. Chill
    Remove from oven, cool completely, then refrigerate for at least 4–6 hours (overnight best).
    (Comment: Chilling allows the cheesecake to firm up and flavors to blend.)

8. Serve
    Run a knife around the edge before releasing the springform.
    Slice with a hot knife (dip in hot water, wipe between cuts) for clean slices.
    Top with fresh berries, chocolate drizzle, or fruit compote if desired.
