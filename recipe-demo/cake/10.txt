For the confetti cake:
    3 cups all-purpose flour
    2 tsp baking powder
    ½ tsp baking soda
    1 tsp salt
    1 cup unsalted butter (softened to room temperature)
    ½ cup vegetable oil
    2 cups granulated sugar
    4 large eggs (room temperature)
    1 cup buttermilk (room temperature)
    2 tsp vanilla extract
    ¾ cup rainbow jimmies (the long, thin sprinkles)
For the vanilla buttercream:
    1 ½ cups unsalted butter (softened)
    5 cups powdered sugar (sifted)
    ¼ cup heavy cream or milk
    2 tsp vanilla extract
    Pinch of salt

1. Prepare the cake pans and oven

    Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).

    Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.

2. Mix the dry ingredients

    In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

    Set aside.

3. Cream butter, oil, and sugar

In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the softened butter, oil, and granulated sugar on medium-high speed for 3-4 minutes until very pale and fluffy.

Comment: Using both butter and oil gives the cake a rich buttery flavor while keeping it exceptionally moist.

4. Add eggs and vanilla

Add the room temperature eggs one at a time, mixing well after each until fully incorporated.

Beat in the vanilla extract.

Tip: Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure everything is evenly mixed.

5. Alternate dry and wet ingredients

With the mixer on low speed, add one-third of the dry ingredients, then half of the buttermilk. Repeat, ending with the dry ingredients.

Mix only until just combined to avoid overworking the gluten.

6. Fold in sprinkles

Gently fold in the rainbow jimmies with a rubber spatula.

Tip: Do not overmix, as the colors from the sprinkles can start to bleed into the batter. Use jimmies, not nonpareils (the little balls), for best results.

7. Bake the cakes

Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.

Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Let cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes before inverting them onto a wire rack to cool completely.

8. Make the vanilla buttercream

In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy, about 2 minutes.

Gradually add the sifted powdered sugar, mixing on low speed until combined.

Add the vanilla and salt. Increase speed to medium-high and beat for 3-4 minutes until light and fluffy. Add the cream or milk one tablespoon at a time until you reach a smooth, spreadable consistency.

9. Assemble the cake

Place one cooled cake layer on your serving plate.

Spread an even layer of buttercream over the top.

Place the second cake layer on top, and frost the entire cake.

Comment: For a festive look, press extra sprinkles around the base of the frosted cake.


1. Oven and Pan Preparation

    Position a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C).

    Thoroughly butter two 9-inch round cake pans. Dust them with flour, tapping out any excess. For a flawless release, place a parchment paper circle on the bottom of each pan.

2. Sift the Dry Components

    In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Sifting is not just for mixing; it aerates the flour, which is key to a light, fluffy cake.

    Set your sifted mixture aside for now.

3. Create the Base Batter

    In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the softened butter, vegetable oil, and granulated sugar on medium-high speed.

    Continue for 3-4 minutes until the mixture is significantly lighter in color and has a creamy, whipped texture.

    Comment: The combination of butter for rich flavor and oil for lasting moisture is the secret to the perfect confetti cake texture.

4. Incorporate Eggs and Flavoring

    Add the room temperature eggs individually, allowing each one to fully blend into the batter before adding the next.

    Mix in the vanilla extract.

    Tip: Scraping down the bowl with a spatula after adding the eggs ensures that no heavy batter is left at the bottom.

5. Build the Cake Batter

    Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add about a third of your dry ingredients, followed by half of the buttermilk.

    Repeat this alternating process, finishing with the last of the dry ingredients. Mix only until you no longer see white streaks of flour.

6. Add the Sprinkles

    Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to gently fold in the rainbow jimmies.

    Tip: Use long, jimmie-style sprinkles. The small, round nonpareils are more likely to dissolve and bleed their color throughout the batter during baking. Fold them in with just a few turns of the spatula to minimize color streaking.

7. Bake to Perfection

    Carefully divide the finished batter between your two prepared pans, smoothing the tops with your spatula.

    Bake for 30–35 minutes. The cakes are done when they are golden, and a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.

    Let the cakes rest in their pans on a wire rack for about 15 minutes. This allows them to set before you invert them out of the pans to cool completely.

8. Whip up the Buttercream

    In a large, clean bowl, beat the softened butter with a mixer for about 2 minutes until it's smooth and pale.

    With the mixer on low, gradually add the sifted powdered sugar. Once it's mostly incorporated, add the vanilla and salt.

    Increase the speed to medium-high and whip for another 3-4 minutes. Drizzle in the heavy cream as it whips, until the frosting is light, airy, and easily spreadable.

9. Assemble Your Masterpiece

    Place one fully cooled cake layer onto your cake stand or serving plate.

    Apply a generous layer of buttercream on top, spreading it evenly.

    Carefully position the second cake layer on top, then apply a thin "crumb coat" of frosting over the entire cake. Chill for 15 minutes before applying the final, thicker layer of frosting.

    Comment: The crumb coat is a thin layer of frosting that traps any loose crumbs, ensuring your final coat of frosting is clean and beautiful.
