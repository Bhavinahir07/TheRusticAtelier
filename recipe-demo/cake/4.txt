For the cake batter:
    2 cups all-purpose flour
    1 cup granulated sugar
    ½ cup unsalted butter (softened)
    1 cup sour cream (adds moistness and tang)
    2 large eggs (room temperature)
    2 tsp baking powder
    ½ tsp baking soda
    ½ tsp salt
    2 tsp vanilla extract
For the streusel topping (and filling):
    ¾ cup brown sugar (packed)
    1 cup all-purpose flour
    1 ½ tsp ground cinnamon
    ½ cup cold unsalted butter (cubed)
    ½ cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional, for crunch)

1. Preheat oven and prepare pan
    Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
    Grease and flour a 9×13-inch baking pan (or use parchment for easy removal).
    Tip: Glass pans may bake faster, so check a few minutes early.
2. Make the streusel topping/filling
    In a bowl, combine brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon.
    Cut in cold butter cubes using a pastry cutter or fingers until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
    Stir in nuts if using.
    Comment: Keep butter cold for a crumbly, crunchy topping.
3. Mix the dry ingredients for the cake
    In another large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
    Set aside.
4. Cream the butter and sugar
    In a mixing bowl, beat softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy (about 2–3 minutes).
    Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each.
    Mix in vanilla extract.
    Tip: Creaming traps air, giving the cake a lighter texture.
5. Add sour cream and dry ingredients
    Mix in sour cream until combined.
    Gradually fold in the dry flour mixture until just incorporated.
    Comment: Do not overmix; too much mixing makes the cake dense.
6. Assemble the cake layers
    Spread half of the cake batter into the prepared pan.
    Sprinkle half of the streusel mixture over it.
    Spread remaining batter gently on top.
    Finish with the remaining streusel as the top layer.
    Tip: Use an offset spatula to spread batter without disturbing the filling.
7. Bake the cake
    Bake for 35–40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
    Remove and cool in the pan on a wire rack.
    Comment: Cooling helps the crumb set so it slices cleanly.
8. Serve and enjoy
    Slice into squares and serve warm or at room temperature.
    Tip: Tastes amazing with a cup of coffee or tea! Can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for 2–3 days.
