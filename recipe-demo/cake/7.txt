For Soaked Fruits
    2 cups mixed dried fruits (raisins, currants, chopped dates, apricots, figs)
    ½ cup mixed candied peel or glace cherries
    ½ cup chopped nuts (walnuts, almonds, pecans)
    ½ cup dark rum, brandy, or orange juice (for non-alcoholic)
For Cake Batter
    2 cups all-purpose flour (sifted)
    1 tsp baking powder
    ½ tsp baking soda
    1 tsp ground cinnamon
    ½ tsp ground nutmeg
    ¼ tsp ground cloves
    ½ tsp salt
    1 cup unsalted butter (softened)
    1 cup brown sugar (packed, gives rich flavor)
    4 large eggs (room temperature)
    ½ cup molasses or golden syrup (adds depth & moisture)
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    Zest of 1 orange and 1 lemon
For Brushing (optional, if aging)
    Extra brandy, rum, or fruit juice

1. Prepare the Fruit Mixture
    Place dried fruits, candied peel, and chopped nuts in a bowl.
    Pour in brandy/rum or orange juice.
    Cover and soak overnight (at least 12 hours).
    Tip: Soaking overnight plumps the fruits and infuses them with flavor. For deeper taste, you can soak them weeks in advance.
2. Prepare Cake Pan
    Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C).
    Line a deep 9-inch round or 8-inch square cake pan with parchment paper. Wrap the outside with brown paper or foil to prevent over-browning.
    Comment: Fruit cakes bake long and slow – insulating the pan avoids burning edges.
3. Make the Batter
    In a bowl, sift flour, baking powder, soda, salt, and spices. Set aside.
    Cream butter and brown sugar together until light and fluffy.
    Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
    Mix in molasses, vanilla, and citrus zest.
    Tip: Adding molasses not only sweetens but also keeps the cake moist for longer storage.
4. Combine Fruits and Batter
    Toss soaked fruits in 2 tbsp of the flour mixture (prevents sinking).
    Fold the dry ingredients into the creamed butter mixture.
    Gently fold in the fruits and nuts until evenly distributed.
    Batter will be thick.
5. Bake
    Pour batter into the prepared pan. Smooth top and decorate with extra nuts or cherries if desired.
    Bake for 2 hours 15 minutes – 2 hours 30 minutes.
    Check doneness by inserting a skewer into the center – it should come out almost clean (moist crumbs are fine).
    Comment: Slow baking ensures a moist, evenly baked cake without drying out.
6. Cool & Store
    Cool cake in the pan for 30 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.
    If storing/aging, wrap in parchment, then foil, and keep in an airtight tin.
    Brush with rum, brandy, or juice once a week for up to 6 weeks before serving.
    Tip: Fruit cakes actually improve with time – aging develops a deep, rich flavor.
