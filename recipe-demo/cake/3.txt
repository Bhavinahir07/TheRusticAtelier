For the Chocolate Cake (two 9-inch layers):
    1 ¾ cups (220g) all-purpose flour – spoon and level for accuracy
    2 cups (400g) granulated sugar – balances the bitterness of cocoa
    ¾ cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder – use good-quality Dutch-processed for richer flavor
    2 tsp baking soda – main leavening agent
    1 tsp baking powder – helps rise evenly
    1 tsp salt – enhances chocolate flavor
    2 large eggs (room temperature) – gives structure and richness
    1 cup (240ml) buttermilk – keeps the cake moist and tender
    ½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil – prevents the cake from drying out
    2 tsp pure vanilla extract – flavor enhancer
    1 cup (240ml) hot coffee or hot water – deepens chocolate flavor (coffee won’t make it taste like coffee; it just enhances chocolate)
For the Chocolate Frosting:
    1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, softened – creamy base
    3 ½ cups (440g) powdered sugar, sifted – sweetness & structure
    1 cup (120g) unsweetened cocoa powder – bold chocolate flavor
    ½ tsp salt – balances sweetness
    2 tsp vanilla extract – flavor depth
    ½ cup (120ml) heavy cream (plus more if needed) – makes frosting smooth and spreadable

Instructions

1. Preheat and prepare pans
    Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
    Grease two 9-inch round cake pans with butter or spray, then line bottoms with parchment paper.
    Tip: Parchment guarantees clean cake release.

2. Mix the dry ingredients
    In a large bowl, sift together:
        1 ¾ cups flour
        2 cups sugar
        ¾ cup cocoa powder
        2 tsp baking soda
        1 tsp baking powder
        1 tsp salt
    Whisk until combined.
    Comment: Sifting makes the cocoa blend smoothly without lumps.

3. Add wet ingredients
    Add 2 large eggs, 1 cup buttermilk, ½ cup vegetable oil, and 2 tsp vanilla extract.
    Beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes until smooth.
    Tip: Scrape bowl sides so everything mixes evenly.

4. Add hot coffee
    Slowly pour in 1 cup hot coffee (or hot water) while mixing on low.
    Batter will be thin.
    Comment: The coffee deepens chocolate flavor and keeps the cake moist.

5. Bake the cakes
    Divide batter evenly into the two pans.
    Bake for 30–35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center has a few moist crumbs.
    Cool 10 minutes in pans, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
    Tip: Don’t wait until the toothpick is fully clean—slightly moist crumbs = perfect texture.

6. Make the frosting
    Beat 1 cup softened butter until creamy.
    Add gradually:
        3 ½ cups powdered sugar (sifted)
        1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
        ½ tsp salt
    Mix in 2 tsp vanilla extract and ½ cup heavy cream.
    Beat 3–4 minutes until fluffy.
    Tip: If too thick, add more cream (1 tbsp at a time). For richer taste, mix in melted dark chocolate.

7. Assemble the cake
    Place one cooled cake layer on a plate.
    Spread frosting evenly on top.
    Place second layer and frost top + sides.
    Smooth with a spatula or make decorative swirls.
    Tip: Chill the cake 20 minutes before slicing for neat cuts.
