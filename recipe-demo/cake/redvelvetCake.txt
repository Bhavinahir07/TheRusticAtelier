For the Cake
    2 ½ cups (310 g) all-purpose flour
    2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder (adds mild chocolate flavor without overpowering)
    1 tsp baking soda
    ½ tsp salt
    1 ½ cups (300 g) granulated sugar
    1 ½ cups (360 ml) vegetable oil (neutral, like sunflower or canola, keeps the cake moist)
    2 large eggs
    1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk, room temperature (acidic base helps give the cake its velvety texture)
    2 tbsp red food coloring (liquid or gel) (gel gives a richer red without altering texture)
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    1 tsp distilled white vinegar (reacts with baking soda for extra lift)

For the Cream Cheese Frosting
    8 oz (225 g) cream cheese, softened
    ½ cup (115 g) unsalted butter, softened
    4 cups (480 g) powdered sugar, sifted (sifting prevents lumps in the frosting)
    2 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions

1. Preheat & Prepare Pans
    Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
    Grease and flour two 9-inch (23 cm) round cake pans, or line with parchment paper.
    (Tip: Parchment ensures cakes release easily and stay intact when layered.)

2. Mix Dry Ingredients
    In a medium bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
    (Tip: Sifting aerates the flour, leading to a lighter crumb.)

3. Beat Sugar & Oil
    In a large mixing bowl, whisk sugar and oil until well combined.
    Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until smooth and fluffy.
    (Comment: Oil gives moisture; eggs provide structure — both balance to achieve velvety texture.)

4. Add Flavor Base
    Stir in vanilla extract, red food coloring, and vinegar. Mix until evenly distributed.
    (Tip: Vinegar is key for authentic red velvet—it enhances both color and rise.)

5. Combine Wet & Dry with Buttermilk
    Alternate adding the dry flour mixture and buttermilk into the wet mixture, beginning and ending with flour.
    Gently fold with a spatula or low-speed mixer until just combined.
    (Important: Do not overmix—this can make the cake dense. Stop as soon as no streaks of flour remain.)

6. Bake
    Divide batter evenly into prepared pans and smooth the tops.
    Bake for 28–32 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
    Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes before transferring to wire racks.
    (Tip: Cooling too quickly may cause cracks; be patient and let them release naturally.)

7. Make Cream Cheese Frosting
    In a large bowl, beat softened cream cheese and butter until creamy.
    Gradually add sifted powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, until fully incorporated.
    Beat in vanilla extract until frosting is light and fluffy.
    (Tip: Chill frosting for 15 minutes before spreading to make it easier to handle.)

8. Assemble the Cake
    Place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake board. Spread an even layer of frosting on top.
    Place the second cake layer, then cover the top and sides with frosting.
    Garnish with cake crumbs, red sprinkles, or white chocolate shavings.
    (Comment: Using crumbs from trimmed cake edges is a traditional Southern garnish that signals authenticity.)
