For the vanilla sponge cake:
    2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
    2 ½ tsp baking powder
    ½ tsp salt
    4 large eggs (room temperature)
    2 cups granulated sugar
    1 cup whole milk (warmed)
    ½ cup unsalted butter (melted)
    2 tsp vanilla extract
For the espresso syrup:
    1 ½ cups freshly brewed strong coffee or espresso (cooled)
    ¼ cup coffee liqueur (like Kahlúa or Tia Maria, optional)
    2 tbsp granulated sugar
For the mascarpone frosting:
    16 oz (2 cups) mascarpone cheese (cold)
    1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream (cold)
    1 cup powdered sugar (sifted)
    2 tsp vanilla extract
    Unsweetened cocoa powder (for dusting)

1. Initial Oven and Pan Setup

    Position an oven rack in the center and preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).

    Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper circles to ensure a clean release.

2. Prepare the Dry Ingredients

    In a medium bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Sifting is especially important here for achieving the light, airy texture of a sponge cake.

3. Create the Sponge Batter

    In a large bowl, using an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the room-temperature eggs and granulated sugar on high speed for 5-7 minutes. The mixture should be thick, pale yellow, and tripled in volume.

    Comment: This step is crucial. Whipping the eggs thoroughly creates the airy sponge structure that is the hallmark of this cake.

    In a separate bowl, whisk together the warm milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract.

    With the mixer on low, slowly stream the milk mixture into the whipped eggs. Mix just until combined.

4. Finalize and Bake the Sponge

    Gently fold the sifted dry ingredients into the wet ingredients in two additions, using a large spatula. Be careful not to deflate the air you whipped into the eggs.

    Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.

    Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

    Let the cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes before inverting them onto a wire rack to cool completely.

5. Mix the Espresso Syrup

    While the cakes cool, prepare the soak. In a small bowl, stir together the cooled espresso, optional coffee liqueur, and granulated sugar until the sugar is fully dissolved. Set this aside.

6. Whip the Mascarpone Frosting

    In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the cold heavy cream on medium-high speed until it forms stiff peaks. Transfer the whipped cream to another bowl.

    In the same now-empty mixer bowl, gently beat the cold mascarpone cheese and sifted powdered sugar on low speed just until combined and smooth.

    Tip: Do not overbeat the mascarpone, as its delicate fats can break and cause it to become grainy. Mix only until it is smooth.

    Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture with a spatula, along with the vanilla extract, until it is uniform in texture and no streaks remain.

7. Assemble the Tiramisu Cake

    Once the cake layers are completely cool, use a long serrated knife to level the tops if they have domed.

    Place one cake layer on your serving platter. Using a pastry brush, generously soak the entire surface of the cake with about half of the espresso syrup.

    Spread a thick, even layer (about one-third) of the mascarpone frosting over the soaked cake.

    Place the second cake layer on top and soak it with the remaining espresso syrup.

    Cover the top and sides of the entire cake with the rest of the mascarpone frosting.

8. Chill and Garnish

    Refrigerate the assembled cake for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight.

    Comment: Chilling is an essential step. It allows the syrup to fully permeate the cake and lets the frosting set, which melds the flavors and makes for clean, beautiful slices.

    Just before serving, use a fine-mesh sieve to dust the top of the cake generously with unsweetened cocoa powder.
