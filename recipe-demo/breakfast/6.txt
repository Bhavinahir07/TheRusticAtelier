For the Dough (Détrempe):
    4 cups (500g) bread flour
    ¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar
    2 tsp (11g) active dry yeast
    1 ¾ tsp (10g) fine sea salt
    1 ¼ cups (300ml) whole milk, lukewarm (around 105°F / 40°C)
For the Butter Block (Beurrage):
    1 ¼ cups (285g / 2.5 sticks) high-fat European-style unsalted butter (at least 82% butterfat), cold
For Assembly:
    24-30 (approx. 200g) dark chocolate bâtons (baking sticks)
    1 large egg, beaten with 1 tbsp of water (for the egg wash)

1. Make the Dough (Détrempe)
    In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the bread flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.
    Add the lukewarm milk. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms.
    Increase the speed to medium-low and knead for 4-5 minutes. The dough should be smooth and elastic but not overly developed.
    Comment: You want some gluten, but not too much, as you will be working it more during the turns.
    Form the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until puffy (it may not double).
    Gently deflate the dough, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
2. Make the Butter Block (Beurrage)
    Arrange the cold sticks of butter side-by-side on a large piece of parchment paper.
    Cover with another piece of parchment and beat the butter with a rolling pin to flatten and soften it slightly.
    Form the butter into a precise 8x8 inch square by folding the parchment paper around it and using the rolling pin to press it into the corners.
    Chill this butter block in the refrigerator until firm, about 30 minutes.
3. The Lamination (Enclosing the Butter)
    Lightly flour your work surface. Turn out the chilled dough.
    Roll the dough into a 12x12 inch square.
    Place the 8x8 inch firm butter block in the center, rotated 45 degrees (like a diamond in a square).
    Fold the four "corners" of the dough over the butter to meet in the middle, pinching the seams to seal the butter in completely. You should have a square packet.
4. The First "Turn" (A Book Fold)
    Lightly flour your surface. Roll the packet into a long rectangle, about 24x8 inches.
    Perform a "book fold": Fold the two short ends to meet in the exact center. Then, fold the entire thing in half, like closing a book.
    You now have a small, thick square with 4 layers of butter.
    Wrap this packet tightly in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
5. The Second "Turn" (A Letter Fold)
    Place the chilled packet on a floured surface. Roll it out again into a long 24x8 inch rectangle.
    Perform a "letter fold": Fold the top third of the dough down to the center. Fold the bottom third up over it (like folding a business letter).
    You now have a packet with 3x4 = 12 layers of butter.
    Wrap tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
    Day 2: Shaping, Proofing, and Baking6. Roll, Trim, and Cut
    Place the final chilled dough on a floured surface. Roll it out into a large rectangle, about 16x20 inches, and about 1/4-inch thick.
    Crucial Step: Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to trim all four edges. This exposes the layers, which is essential for a good rise.
    Cut the large rectangle into 12-15 smaller rectangles, each about 5x4 inches.
7. Shape the Pains
    Place one dough rectangle on your work surface. Place one chocolate bâton about half an inch from the bottom edge.
    Fold the bottom edge of the dough up and over the chocolate stick.
    Place a second chocolate bâton right against this new fold.
    Roll the dough the rest of the way up to enclose the second stick. You will finish with the seam-side down.
    Place the shaped pain on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the rest, leaving 3-4 inches of space between them.
8. The Final Proof
    Cover the baking sheets loosely with plastic wrap.
    Let the pastries proof in a warm (but not hot) room (around 75°F / 24°C) for 1.5 to 2.5 hours.
    Comment: This is the final rise. The pastries will become noticeably puffy, and you will be able to see the layers separating slightly. They will feel airy, not dense.
    While they proof, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
9. Bake to Perfection
    Gently brush the puffed pastries only on their tops with the egg wash. Avoid letting the egg wash drip down the sides, as this can seal the layers together.
    Bake for 12-15 minutes, then rotate the pan.
    Continue baking for another 5-10 minutes, or until the pastries are a deep, rich, golden-brown.
10. Serve
    Let the Pains au Chocolat cool on the pan for 5-10 minutes (the chocolate inside is molten).
    They are best served warm, on the day they are made.
