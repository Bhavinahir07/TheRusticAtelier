For the Eggs:
    4 large eggs (the fresher, the better)
    1 tbsp unsalted butter (cold)
    1 tsp whole milk or heavy cream (optional, for extra richness)
    Pinch of fine sea salt
    Freshly cracked black pepper
For Serving:
    Fresh chopped chives (classic pairing)
    Buttered toast

1. Crack and Whisk
    Crack the eggs into a medium bowl.
    Add the optional splash of milk or cream if using.
    Whisk the eggs vigorously until the yolks and whites are completely completely combined and the mixture is a uniform pale yellow color. You want to incorporate some air, but mostly you want a uniform texture.
    Tip: Do not add salt yet. Adding salt to raw eggs and letting them sit can break down the eggs and make them watery. Salt at the end or just before cooking.
2. Begin with Butter
    Place a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.
    Add the tablespoon of butter. Let it melt and start to foam slightly, but do not let it brown.
3. Pour and Push (The Technique)
    Pour the whisked eggs into the center of the pan.
    Let them sit for just a second until the edges barely start to set.
    Using a silicone spatula, gently push the eggs from the edges toward the center of the pan.
    Continue this "push and fold" motion constantly. As you push the cooked egg to the center, liquid egg will flow to the empty spaces to cook.
    Comment: The goal is to create soft, ribbon-like folds (curds). Do not chop at the eggs; fold them gently.
4. Low and Slow
    If the eggs seem to be cooking too fast (hardening instantly), remove the pan from the heat for a moment and keep stirring. You want this process to be gradual to keep them creamy.
    Continue stirring and folding until the eggs are mostly set but still look slightly wet and shiny.
5. Finish off the Heat
    Crucial Step: When the eggs look almost done (about 90% cooked), remove the pan from the heat entirely.
    The residual heat in the pan will finish cooking the eggs in the next 30-60 seconds.
    Season immediately with a pinch of fine sea salt and cracked black pepper. Stir one last time.
6. Serve
    Slide the soft, creamy eggs onto a warm plate or a slice of buttered toast.
    Garnish with fresh chopped chives and serve immediately. Scrambled eggs wait for no one!
