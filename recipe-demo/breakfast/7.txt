For the Syrniki:
    1 lb (approx. 450g or 2 cups) dry Farmer's Cheese (Tvorog), or dry curd cottage cheese
    1 large egg
    3 tbsp (40g) granulated sugar (or to taste)
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    1 pinch of fine sea salt
    3 tbsp (30g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
For Cooking & Serving:
    2-3 tbsp unsalted butter or a neutral oil (like canola), for frying
    Toppings: Sour cream (traditional), fruit jam (like raspberry or strawberry), honey, powdered sugar, fresh berries.

1. Prepare the Cheese (Crucial Step)
    Your tvorog (farmer's cheese) must be dry. If it seems wet, place it in a cheesecloth or a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl and press to remove as much moisture as possible.
    Comment: This is the most important step. If your cheese is too wet, the batter will be sticky, and you'll be forced to add too much flour, resulting in dense, rubbery syrniki.
2. Mix the Batter
    In a medium bowl, add the dry tvorog. Use a fork to break it up until it's crumbly.
    Add the egg, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and pinch of salt. Mix with the fork until just combined.
    Add the 3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour. Fold it in gently with a spatula until it's just incorporated.
    Tip: Do not overmix and do not add extra flour, even if the "dough" seems sticky. It's meant to be delicate.
3. Shape the Syrniki
    Spread a small amount of all-purpose flour onto a clean plate or work surface.
    Lightly flour your hands. Scoop about 2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture and gently roll it into a ball.
    Carefully flatten the ball into a thick patty, about 1 inch thick.
    Lightly dredge all sides of the patty in the flour on the plate and shake off any excess. This light flour coating will help it get a beautiful golden crust.
    Place the shaped patty on a clean plate and repeat with the remaining mixture.
4. Pan-Fry the Syrniki
    Place a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add 1-2 tablespoons of butter (or oil) and let it melt.
    Gently place 4-5 syrniki patties in the hot pan, leaving space between them.
    Fry for 3-5 minutes on the first side, undisturbed, until a deep golden-brown crust has formed.
    Comment: The heat must be medium-low. If it's too high, the outside will burn before the egg in the center has a chance to cook and set.
    Carefully flip the syrniki and cook for another 3-5 minutes on the second side, until also golden brown and cooked through.
5. Serve Immediately
    Transfer the cooked syrniki to a plate (you can keep them warm in a 200°F / 95°C oven while you cook the remaining batches, adding more butter to the pan as needed).
    Serve the syrniki hot, topped with a generous dollop of sour cream and a side of your favorite jam.
