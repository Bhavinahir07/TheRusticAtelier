For the Yeast Batter:
    2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour
    1 cup (240ml) warm milk (about 110°F / 43°C)
    2 ¼ tsp (1 packet / 7g) instant dry yeast (or 25g fresh yeast)
    1 tbsp granulated sugar
    1 large egg, room temperature
    1 pinch of salt
For the Filling:
    2 medium apples (tart varieties like Granny Smith work best), peeled, cored, and cut into small chunks or thin slices
For Frying & Serving:
    Vegetable oil (like canola or sunflower) or clarified butter, for frying
    Powdered sugar, for dusting

1. Activate the Yeast
    In a large bowl, pour in the warm milk. Add the sugar and the yeast.
    Whisk gently and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until the mixture is frothy.
    Comment: If the milk doesn't foam, your yeast is dead or the milk was too hot. You need that foam for the pancakes to rise.
2. Make the Batter
    Add the flour, the egg, and the pinch of salt to the yeast mixture.
    Using a wooden spoon, mix vigorously until a smooth, thick batter forms.
    Tip: The texture should be much thicker than American pancake batter. It should be sticky and unwilling to drip easily off the spoon (more like a very loose bread dough).
3. Add the Apples
    Peel and core the apples. You can either slice them into thin half-moons or chop them into small cubes (cubes are easier to eat).
    Add the apple pieces to the batter and fold them in until they are evenly distributed.
4. Let the Batter Rise (Proof)
    Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel.
    Place it in a warm, draft-free spot for 45 to 60 minutes.
    The batter is ready when it has doubled in size and looks very bubbly and airy.
5. Fry the Racuchy
    Heat a generous amount of oil (about ¼ inch deep) in a large skillet over medium-low heat.
    Comment: Temperature control is key. Because these pancakes are thick and contain raw apples, they need to cook slowly. If the heat is too high, the outside will burn before the inside is cooked.
    Dip a large spoon into a glass of hot water (this prevents sticking), then scoop a spoonful of the batter and drop it into the hot oil. Flatten it slightly with the back of the spoon.
    Fry for about 3-4 minutes per side, until they are a deep golden brown and puffed up.
6. Drain and Serve
    Remove the racuchy from the pan and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.
    Arrange them on a serving platter and dust generously with powdered sugar (this is the traditional topping, though some people use sour cream).
    Serve warm.
