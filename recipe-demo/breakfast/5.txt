For the Dough (Enriched Dough):
    1 cup (240ml) whole milk, warm (about 110°F / 43°C)
    2 ¼ tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast
    ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar, divided
    ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
    2 large eggs, at room temperature
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    4 cups (480g) all-purpose flour
    1 tsp salt
For the Filling:
    ¾ cup (170g) unsalted butter, very soft (at room temperature)
    1 cup (220g) brown sugar, packed
    2 tbsp ground cinnamon
For the Cream Cheese Icing:
    4 oz (113g) cream cheese, very soft
    ¼ cup (57g) unsalted butter, very soft
    1 ½ cups (180g) powdered sugar
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    1 pinch of salt
    1-2 tbsp milk (optional, for thinning)

1. Activate the Yeast (Bloom)

    In the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large bowl), pour in the warm milk. Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the granulated sugar.

    Gently whisk and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. It should become foamy and bubbly.

    Comment: This "blooming" step proves your yeast is alive. If it doesn't foam, your yeast is dead or the milk was too hot/cold, and you must start over.

2. Make the Dough

    To the foamy yeast mixture, add the remaining granulated sugar, the melted butter, the room-temperature eggs, and the vanilla extract. Whisk to combine.

    Add the all-purpose flour and the salt.

    Using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 8-10 minutes.

    Tip (Kneading): The dough should be smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky. It will pull away cleanly from the sides of the bowl. If kneading by hand, do so on a lightly floured surface for the same amount of time.

3. The First Rise (Proof)

    Lightly grease a large, clean bowl with oil. Form your dough into a ball and place it in the bowl, turning it over once to coat.

    Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel.

    Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free spot for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.

4. Make the Filling

    While the dough rises, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the very soft butter, packed brown sugar, and cinnamon.

    Mix with a spatula until it forms a thick, smooth, spreadable paste.

    Tip: Your butter must be soft, not melted. Melted butter will leak out of the rolls during baking.

5. Roll and Fill the Dough

    Once the dough has doubled, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently punch it down.

    Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 18x12 inches.

    Spread the cinnamon-sugar filling evenly over the dough, all the way to the edges.

6. Roll, Slice, and Arrange

    Starting from one of the long (18-inch) edges, roll the dough up into a tight log.

    Use a sharp knife or (even better) unflavored dental floss to cut the log into 12 equal-sized rolls.

    Tip (Dental Floss): Slide a piece of floss under the log, bring the ends up, and cross them over to slice through the dough without squishing the rolls.

    Place the 12 rolls cut-side-up in a 9x13 inch baking dish that has been generously greased with butter.

7. The Second Rise (Proof)

    Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel.

    Place it back in a warm spot and let the rolls rise again for 45-60 minutes. They should become "puffy" and will start to touch each other.

    While the rolls are rising, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

8. Bake the Rolls

    Once risen, place the baking dish in the preheated oven.

    Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the rolls are a deep golden brown on top and the centers are cooked through.

    Comment: If they brown too quickly, you can loosely tent the top with aluminum foil for the last 10 minutes.

9. Make the Icing

    While the rolls are baking, make the icing. In a medium bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the very soft cream cheese and very soft butter on high speed until completely smooth and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).

    Add the powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and pinch of salt. Beat on low speed to combine, then increase to high and beat for another 2 minutes until light and airy. If it's too thick, add milk 1 tablespoon at a time.

10. Frost and Serve

    Remove the rolls from the oven and let them cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes.

    Tip: Frosting them while they are still warm (but not piping hot) is key. The icing will melt slightly, seeping into all the crevices.

    Spread the cream cheese icing generously over the tops of the warm rolls. Serve immediately.
