For the Dry Ingredients:
    2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour
    1 tbsp granulated sugar
    1 tbsp baking powder
    ½ tsp salt
For the Wet Ingredients:
    2 large eggs, separated (yolks and whites in different bowls)
    1 ¾ cups (420ml) milk (whole milk or 2% recommended)
    ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
    1 tsp vanilla extract

1. Separate the Eggs
    This is the most important step for a light waffle. Carefully separate the eggs, placing the egg yolks in a large mixing bowl and the egg whites in a separate, perfectly clean medium bowl.
    Tip: Any trace of fat or yolk in the egg whites will prevent them from whipping properly.
2. Mix the Dry Ingredients
    In a separate, medium-sized bowl, add the all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
    Whisk them together thoroughly to ensure the baking powder is evenly distributed.
3. Mix the "Wet Base"
    To the large bowl containing the egg yolks, add the milk, the cooled melted butter, and the vanilla extract.
    Whisk these ingredients together until fully combined.
    Pour the combined dry ingredients (from Step 2) into this wet base. Whisk until it is just combined.
    Comment: Just like with pancakes, do not overmix. A few small lumps are perfectly fine.
4. Whip the Egg Whites (The Secret)
    Using an electric hand mixer (or a stand mixer with a whisk attachment), beat the egg whites on medium-high speed.
    Continue beating for 3-5 minutes, until they form stiff, glossy peaks. This means when you lift the beater out, the peak that forms holds its shape and doesn't flop over.
5. Fold in the Egg Whites
    Take about one-third of the whipped egg whites and stir them into the batter. This is called "lightening the batter" and makes the next step easier.
    Add the remaining two-thirds of the egg whites to the bowl. Using a silicone spatula, gently fold them in. Use a "cut-down-the-middle, scrape-up-the-side" motion.
    Crucial Step: Be gentle! You are trying to keep all the air you just whipped into the whites. Stop folding as soon as you no longer see large streaks of egg white. The final batter should be light, airy, and voluminous.
6. Cook the Waffles
    Preheat your waffle iron according to its manufacturer's instructions.
    Once hot, lightly grease the waffle iron (if yours is not non-stick).
    Pour the correct amount of batter for your machine (usually ½ to ¾ cup) onto the center of the iron and close the lid.
    Cook for 3-5 minutes, or until the waffle is a deep golden brown and is crispy on the outside. Most modern waffle irons have an indicator light.
    Tip: Do not open the waffle iron early! The waffle will split. Wait until the "steaming" from the iron has mostly stopped.
7. Serve Immediately
    Carefully remove the finished waffle and serve it immediately.
    To Keep Warm: If making a large batch, you can place finished waffles in a single layer on a baking sheet in a 200°F (95°C) oven to keep them warm and crisp while you cook the rest.
