For the Dough (Détrempe):
    1 ¾ cups (420ml) whole milk, lukewarm (about 105°F / 40°C)
    2 ½ tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast
    ¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar
    4 cups (500g) bread flour

    1 tsp ground cardamom (optional, but highly authentic)
    1 tsp salt
For the Butter Block (Beurrage):
    1 ¼ cups (285g / 2.5 sticks) cold, high-fat (82%+) European-style unsalted butter
For the Almond Filling (Remonce):
    ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, very soft
    ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar
    1 cup (100g) almond flour
    1 tbsp all-purpose flour
    1 tsp almond extract
For the Egg Wash & Glaze:
    1 large egg, beaten with 1 tbsp of water
    1 cup (120g) powdered sugar
    2-3 tbsp milk or cream
    ½ tsp vanilla extract

Day 1: The Dough and Lamination

1. Make the Dough (Détrempe)

    In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the warm milk, yeast, and a pinch of the sugar. Let sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy (bloomed).

    Add the bread flour, remaining sugar, beaten eggs, cardamom, and salt.

    Using the dough hook, mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms.

    Comment: Knead for only 2-3 minutes. Unlike bread, you do not want to develop much gluten. The dough should just come together smoothly.

    Form the dough into a rough square, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or up to 8.

2. Make the Butter Block (Beurrage)

    Arrange the cold sticks of butter on a piece of parchment paper to form a rough square.

    Cover with another piece of parchment and beat the butter with a rolling pin to flatten it.

    Fold the parchment to create a precise 8x8 inch square. Use the rolling pin to press the butter into this shape.

    Chill this butter block in the refrigerator until firm but pliable, about 30 minutes. (It should be the same consistency as the chilled dough).

3. The Lamination (Enclosing the Butter)

    Turn the chilled dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll it into a 12x12 inch square.

    Place the 8x8 inch butter block in the center, rotated 45 degrees (like a diamond in a square).

    Fold the four "corners" of the dough over the butter to meet in the middle, pinching the seams to seal the butter in completely.

4. The First "Turn" (A Letter Fold)

    Lightly flour your surface. Roll the packet into a long rectangle, about 24x8 inches.

    Perform a "letter fold": Fold the top third of the dough down to the center. Fold the bottom third up over it (like folding a business letter).

    You now have a packet with 3 layers of butter.

    Wrap this packet tightly in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

5. The Second & Third "Turns"

    Repeat the entire process from Step 4:

    Place the chilled packet on a floured surface, with the "seam" to the side (a 90-degree rotation).

    Roll it out into a 24x8 inch rectangle.

    Perform another "letter fold."

    Wrap tightly and chill for another 1 hour.

    Repeat this process one third time. This creates 3x3x3 = 27 layers.

    After the third turn, wrap the dough very tightly in plastic wrap and chill overnight.

Day 2: Shaping, Proofing, and Baking

6. Make the Almond Remonce

    In a medium bowl, combine the very soft butter, sugar, almond flour, all-purpose flour, and almond extract. Beat with a spatula until it forms a smooth, thick paste. Set aside.

7. Roll and Cut the Dough

    Remove the chilled dough block. Cut it in half (it's easier to work with). Rewrap one half and return it to the fridge.

    On a lightly floured surface, roll the first half of the dough into a large, thin rectangle (about 16x12 inches).

    Crucial Step: Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to trim all four edges. This trimming exposes the layers and is essential for a good, even rise.

    Cut the trimmed rectangle into eight 4x4 inch squares.

8. Shape the Pastries ("Kite" or "Envelope")

    Place a small spoonful (about 1 tbsp) of the almond remonce in the exact center of each square.

    To shape: Take each of the four corners of the square and fold them in so they all meet and overlap slightly in the center, right on top of the filling.

    Press down firmly in the center to seal the corners together.

    Place the shaped pastries on parchment-lined baking sheets, leaving 3-4 inches of space between them. Repeat with the second half of the dough.

9. The Final Proof (Crucial)

    Cover the baking sheets loosely with plastic wrap.

    Let the pastries proof in a warm, draft-free room (around 75°F / 24°C) for 1.5 to 2 hours.

    Comment: This is the most important step for a light pastry. They will become very puffy, airy, and will jiggle "like jelly" when the pan is nudged. If they are under-proofed, they will be dense and the butter will leak out during baking.

    Near the end of the proofing time, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

10. Bake to Perfection

    Gently brush the puffed pastries only on their tops with the egg wash. Avoid letting it drip down the sides, as this can glue the layers shut.

    Bake for 12-15 minutes, then rotate the pan.

    Continue baking for another 5-8 minutes, until the pastries are a deep, rich, golden-brown and feel light when picked up.

11. Glaze and Serve

    Let the pastries cool on a wire rack for 10-15 minutes (they are very delicate when hot).

    While they cool, whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and 2 tbsp of milk. Add more milk, 1 tsp at a time, until you have a smooth, drizzly glaze.

    Drizzle the glaze over the warm pastries. These are best served on the day they are made.
