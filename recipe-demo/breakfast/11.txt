For the Buttermilk Biscuits:
    2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (Southern "White Lily" flour is ideal if available)
    1 tbsp baking powder
    ¼ tsp baking soda
    1 tsp salt
    ½ cup (113g / 1 stick) unsalted butter, frozen or very cold, cut into small cubes
    ¾ cup (180ml) cold buttermilk (plus extra for brushing)
For the Sausage Gravy:
    1 lb (450g) pork breakfast sausage (ground, loose)
    ⅓ cup (40g) all-purpose flour
    3 to 4 cups (700-950ml) whole milk, warmed slightly
    ½ tsp salt (or to taste)
    1-2 tsp coarsely ground black pepper (to taste)
    pinch of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)

1. Prepare the Biscuit Dough
    Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
    Add the cold cubed butter. Use a pastry blender (or your fingers) to "cut" the butter into the flour until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs with some pea-sized chunks of butter remaining.
    Comment: Do not overwork the butter. Those pea-sized chunks are what create the flakes.
2. Mix and Fold (The Layering Technique)
    Make a well in the center and pour in the cold buttermilk. Stir gently with a fork just until a shaggy dough forms.
    Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently pat it into a rectangle.
    Fold the dough: Fold the dough in half over itself, turn it 90 degrees, and pat it down again. Repeat this folding process 3-4 times.
    Tip: This folding technique creates the physical layers in the biscuit.
3. Cut and Bake the Biscuits
    Pat the dough out to about 1-inch thickness.
    Use a round biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits.
    Crucial Technique: Press the cutter straight down and pull it straight up. Do not twist. Twisting seals the edges and prevents the biscuit from rising high.
    Place the biscuits on the baking sheet so they are just touching each other (this helps them rise taller rather than spreading out).
    Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the tops are golden brown.
4. Brown the Sausage
    While the biscuits bake, place a large skillet (cast iron is traditional) over medium-high heat.
    Add the ground pork sausage. Break it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks.
    Cook for 6-8 minutes until the sausage is fully browned and no pink remains. Do not drain the fat. You need that fat to make the gravy!
5. Make the Roux
    Lower the heat to medium. Sprinkle the flour evenly over the cooked sausage.
    Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes. The flour should soak up the grease and coat the meat. Cook until the flour smells slightly nutty (like cooked pie crust) rather than raw.
6. Build the Gravy
    Slowly pour in 3 cups of the milk while stirring constantly to prevent lumps.
    Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. As it bubbles, the gravy will thicken significantly.
    If it gets too thick (like glue), add more milk, a splash at a time, until it reaches your desired creamy consistency. It should coat the back of a spoon.
7. Season and Serve
    Stir in the salt, the optional pinch of cayenne, and a generous amount of black pepper.
    Tip: Taste the gravy. It usually needs more pepper than you think. It is the primary flavor profile aside from the sausage.
    Split the warm biscuits in half. Place them on a plate and ladle a generous amount of the hot sausage gravy over the top. Serve immediately.
