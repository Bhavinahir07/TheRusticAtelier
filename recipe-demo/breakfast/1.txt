For the Dry Ingredients:
    1 ½ cups (190g) all-purpose flour
    2 tbsp granulated sugar
    1 tbsp baking powder (this is what makes them fluffy)
    ½ tsp salt
For the Wet Ingredients:
    1 ¼ cups (300ml) milk
    1 large egg, lightly beaten
    3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
    1 tsp vanilla extract
For Cooking:
    Unsalted butter or neutral oil (like canola), for the griddle

1. Mix the Dry Ingredients
    In a large bowl, add the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt.
    Whisk them together thoroughly. This ensures the baking powder is evenly distributed, which is key for a uniform rise.
2. Mix the Wet Ingredients
    In a separate, medium-sized bowl, add the milk, the lightly beaten egg, the slightly cooled melted butter, and the vanilla extract.
    Whisk these wet ingredients together until just combined.
3. Combine Wet and Dry (Do Not Overmix!)
    Pour the entire bowl of wet ingredients into the large bowl of dry ingredients.
    Using a spatula or wooden spoon, fold the ingredients together until they are just moistened.
    Comment (Crucial): Stop mixing as soon as there are no more large streaks of dry flour. The batter must be lumpy! If you mix until it is smooth, you will develop the flour's gluten, and your pancakes will be tough and flat, not fluffy.
4. Rest the Batter
    Let the (lumpy) batter rest, undisturbed, at room temperature for at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes.
    Tip: This is the second most important step. During this rest, the flour hydrates, and the baking powder begins to activate, creating bubbles that will result in a much lighter, fluffier pancake.
5. Preheat the Griddle
    Place a large non-stick skillet or a griddle over medium heat. Let it get fully preheated.
    To test if it's ready, flick a tiny drop of water onto the surface. If it sizzles and evaporates immediately, the pan is too hot. If it just sits there, it's too cold. You want the water to "dance" and skitter across the surface before evaporating.
6. Cook the Pancakes
    Lightly grease the hot griddle with a small amount of butter or oil.
    Using a ¼-cup measure, pour the batter onto the griddle, leaving a few inches between each pancake.
    Cook for 2-3 minutes on the first side. You will know it's time to flip when the edges look set and, most importantly, bubbles form on the surface and begin to pop, leaving small holes.
    Gently flip the pancakes and cook on the second side for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.
7. Serve Immediately
    As the pancakes are cooked, you can keep them warm on a baking sheet in a 200°F (95°C) oven.
    Serve the pancakes hot, topped with butter and warm maple syrup.
