The Meat:
    2 thick pork sausages (Cumberland or Lincolnshire recommended)
    2-3 rashers of British Back Bacon (smoked or unsmoked)
    1-2 slices of Black Pudding (optional, but traditional)
The Veg & Sides:
    1 large tomato, halved horizontally
    1 large flat mushroom (portobello) or a handful of button mushrooms
    ½ cup Baked Beans (Heinz is the standard)
    1 slice of bread (for frying or toasting)
    1 Hash Brown (a modern but accepted addition)
The Essentials:
    1-2 large eggs
    Vegetable oil or lard (for frying)
    Salt and black pepper
    Condiments: Brown Sauce (HP Sauce) or Ketchup

1. The Strategy (Read First)
    A Full English is all about timing. You want everything to hit the plate hot. We will use the "one or two pan" method to minimize washing up and maximize flavor transfer.
    Order of Operations: Sausages & Pudding -> Bacon -> Veg -> Beans -> Bread -> Eggs.
2. Start the Sausages
    Place a large frying pan over medium-low heat. Add a little oil.
    Add the sausages. Cook them slowly, turning occasionally, for 15-20 minutes. They take the longest to cook through without burning the skins.
    Tip: If using Hash Browns (frozen), put them in the oven/air fryer now, or fry them in the pan alongside the sausages if there is space.
3. The Black Pudding and Tomatoes
    About 10 minutes into the sausage cooking time, add the slices of black pudding and the tomato halves (cut-side down) to the pan.
    Cook the pudding for 3-4 minutes per side until crispy on the edges. The tomatoes need about 3-5 minutes to char slightly and soften.
    Remove the sausages, pudding, and tomatoes to a warm plate (keep them in a low oven to stay hot).
4. The Bacon and Mushrooms
    Turn the heat up to medium-high. Add the bacon rashers to the hot pan.
    Add the mushrooms to the same pan (they will absorb the delicious bacon fat).
    Fry the bacon for 2-3 minutes per side until the fat renders and the edges crisp up. Fry the mushrooms until golden.
    Move bacon and mushrooms to your warm plate.
5. The Beans and Bread
    Beans: Pour the beans into a small saucepan over low heat. Stir occasionally. They just need to warm through gently; do not boil them rapidly or they turn to mush.
    Fried Bread (Traditional): Add a little more oil or butter to the frying pan (which is now full of bacon/sausage flavor). Add the slice of bread. Fry for 2 minutes per side until golden brown and crisp. (Alternatively, just make toast).
6. The Eggs (The Finale)
    Wipe out the pan slightly if needed, or add a fresh knob of butter.
    Crack the eggs directly into the pan.
    Fry to your liking. For a classic English breakfast, you want a crispy, lacey white bottom and a runny yolk for dipping. This usually takes 2-3 minutes. Basting the yolk with the hot fat helps set the top.
7. Assembly (The Plating)
    This is the final step. Arrange everything on a large, warmed plate.
    The Barrier Method: Use the sausages to create a "breakwater" between the baked beans and the eggs. This prevents the bean juice from making the eggs soggy (a crucial detail for purists!).
    Serve immediately with a mug of tea and a bottle of Brown Sauce.
