For the Dry Ingredients:
    2 cups (160g) old-fashioned rolled oats (do not use instant or quick oats)
    ½ cup chopped pecans or walnuts (optional, but recommended)
    ⅓ cup brown sugar, packed (or maple syrup, see wet ingredients)
    1 tsp baking powder
    1 ½ tsp ground cinnamon
    ¼ tsp ground nutmeg
    ½ tsp salt
For the Wet Ingredients:
    2 cups (480ml) milk (whole milk or 2% recommended)
    2 large eggs
    3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    ⅓ cup maple syrup (if not using brown sugar)
Optional Add-ins:
    1 cup fresh or frozen berries (do not thaw if frozen)
    1 apple, peeled and diced
    ½ cup raisins or dried cranberries

1. Preheat and Prepare the Dish
    Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
    Lightly grease an 8x8 inch square baking dish (or a similar 2-quart casserole dish) with butter or cooking spray.
2. Combine All Dry Ingredients
    In a large bowl, add the old-fashioned rolled oats, chopped nuts (if using), brown sugar (if using), baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
    Whisk these dry ingredients together until they are well combined.
3. Whisk the Wet Ingredients
    In a separate, medium-sized bowl, add the milk and the 2 large eggs. Whisk them together well until the eggs are fully broken up.
    Add the melted butter, vanilla extract, and maple syrup (if using instead of brown sugar). Whisk until everything is fully incorporated.
4. Combine Wet and Dry
    Pour the entire bowl of wet ingredients into the large bowl of dry ingredients.
    Stir with a spatula until everything is just combined.
    Comment: Do not overmix. Just stir until the oats are fully moistened.
    If using any optional add-ins (like berries, diced apple, or raisins), gently fold them in now.
5. Bake the Oatmeal
    Pour the oatmeal mixture into your prepared baking dish. Gently smooth the top with your spatula.
    Bake for 40-45 minutes. The oatmeal is done when the edges are golden brown, pulling away slightly from the sides of the dish, and the center is set (it shouldn't be liquidy).
6. Rest the Oatmeal (Crucial Step)
    Remove the dish from the oven and place it on a cooling rack.
    Tip: You must let the baked oatmeal rest for at least 10 minutes. This resting period allows the custard to finish setting, making it sliceable and preventing it from falling apart.
7. Serve
    Cut the warm baked oatmeal into squares or spoon it into bowls.
    Serve as-is, or with a splash of milk, a drizzle of maple syrup, or a dollop of yogurt.
