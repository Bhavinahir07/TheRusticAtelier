The Essentials:
    1 lb (450g) Bacon slices (Thick-cut is recommended for the best texture)
Optional Flavors (for "Candied" or "Peppery" Bacon):
    Freshly cracked black pepper (highly recommended)
    Brown sugar (for a sweet glaze)
    Maple syrup (for brushing halfway through)
    Cayenne pepper (for heat)
Equipment:
    1 large rimmed baking sheet (sheet pan)
    Aluminum foil (for easy cleanup)
    Oven-safe wire cooling rack (optional, for extra crispiness)

1. Preheat and Prep
    Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
    Line a large, rimmed baking sheet completely with aluminum foil. This makes cleanup as simple as crumpling up the foil and throwing it away.
    The Rack Decision:
    For Crispier Bacon: Place a wire cooling rack on top of the foil. This allows the hot air to circulate under the bacon and the grease to drip away.
    For Chewier Bacon (Confit Style): Place the bacon directly on the foil. It will fry in its own rendered fat.
2. Arrange the Bacon
    Lay the bacon strips out on the rack (or foil) in a single layer.
    The strips can be close together, but do not overlap them, or they will stick together and not crisp properly.
    Optional: If you want Peppery Bacon, grind a generous amount of fresh black pepper over the strips now. If making Candied Bacon, sprinkle a little brown sugar over each strip.
3. Bake
    Place the pan in the center of the preheated oven.
    Timing Guide:
    For Regular Cut Bacon: Check after 12-15 minutes.
    For Thick-Cut Bacon: Check after 15-20 minutes.
    Tip: Ovens vary wildly. Start watching closely at the 12-minute mark. The bacon goes from "perfect" to "burnt" very quickly in the last few minutes.
4. The Texture Check
    The bacon is done when the fat has rendered (turned from opaque white to translucent golden) and the color is a deep reddish-brown.
    Remember that bacon will continue to crisp up as it cools. Remove it from the oven when it looks slightly less crispy than you want it to be.
5. Drain and Serve
    Remove the pan from the oven.
    Using tongs, immediately transfer the hot bacon to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess grease.
    Serve immediately.
6. Cleanup
    Let the bacon grease in the pan cool until it solidifies (about 30 minutes).
    Carefully fold up the aluminum foil containing the grease and discard. Your pan should be perfectly clean!
