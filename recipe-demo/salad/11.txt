The Crunch (The Soul):
    2 rounds Arabic Flatbread/Pita (Khubz), split open into two thin layers
    Vegetable oil (for frying) OR Olive oil (for baking)
    1 tsp Sumac (for dusting the bread)
The Greens & Veg:
    1 head Romaine Lettuce, chopped roughly
    1 bunch Purslane (Bakleh), leaves picked (or substitute watercress/baby arugula)
    3-4 Persian Cucumbers, sliced into half-moons
    3-4 ripe Tomatoes, chopped into chunks
    4-5 Radishes, thinly sliced
    1 bunch Scallions (Green Onions), chopped
    1 cup fresh Mint leaves
    1 cup fresh Flat-leaf Parsley
The Dressing:
    ⅓ cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
    3 tbsp Fresh Lemon Juice
    1-2 tbsp Pomegranate Molasses (adjust for sweetness/tang)
    2 tsp Sumac (plus more for garnish)
    1 clove Garlic, minced
    1 tsp Dried Mint (optional, but authentic)
    Salt and Pepper

1. Prepare the Bread (The Crunch)
    Fried (Traditional): Cut the thin pita layers into 1-inch squares. Heat 1 inch of vegetable oil in a skillet. Fry the bread in batches until golden brown and crisp (it happens fast!). Drain on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with a pinch of sumac and salt.
    Baked (Lighter): Toss the pita squares with olive oil and salt. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 5-8 minutes until golden.
2. Chop the Vegetables (Rustic Style)
    Unlike Tabbouleh (which requires a fine mince), Fattoush is a "rustic" salad. Chop the lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers into bite-sized chunks.
    Leave the mint and parsley leaves whole or roughly torn.
3. Make the Dressing
    In a small jar or bowl, whisk together the minced garlic, lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, sumac, dried mint, salt, and pepper.
    Stream in the olive oil while whisking to create a dark, emulsified dressing.
    Taste: It should be quite tart and tangy.
4. Assemble
    In a large salad bowl, combine the lettuce, purslane, cucumbers, tomatoes, radishes, scallions, fresh mint, and parsley.
    Technique: Do not add the bread yet!
5. The Final Toss
    Just before serving, pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss well to coat.
    Add the fried bread chips last. Give it one gentle toss (or simply pile the bread on top).
    Why? If you toss the bread too early, it will absorb the dressing and turn soggy. You want it to stay crisp.
6. Serve
    Sprinkle with an extra pinch of sumac on top for color.
    Serve immediately.
