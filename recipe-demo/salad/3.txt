The Trio:
    3-4 large, ripe Tomatoes (Bull's Heart or Heirloom varieties are best), room temperature
    2 balls (approx. 250g) Mozzarella di Bufala (in brine), room temperature
    1 large bunch fresh Basil leaves (Genovese basil)
The Dressing:
    Extra Virgin Olive Oil (The highest quality, fruity oil you have)
    Flaky Sea Salt (like Maldon or Fleur de Sel)
    Optional (Modern Twist): A very sparing drizzle of aged balsamic vinegar (purists skip this)

1. Temperature Check
    Ensure your tomatoes and mozzarella have been sitting out of the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Cold mozzarella is rubbery and flavorless; room temperature mozzarella is creamy and savory.
2. Slice
    Slice the tomatoes into ¼-inch thick rounds.
    Slice the mozzarella balls into rounds of the exact same thickness as the tomatoes.
    Tip: Use a serrated knife for the tomatoes to avoid squishing them.
3. Assemble (The Shingle)
    On a large platter, arrange the slices in an alternating pattern: Tomato, Mozzarella, Tomato, Mozzarella.
    Overlap them slightly (like roof shingles) in a circular or spiral pattern.
4. Garnish
    Tuck whole fresh basil leaves between the layers of cheese and tomato.
    Technique: Do not chop the basil with a knife, as it bruises the edges and turns them black. Leave them whole or tear them gently by hand.
5. Dress
    Sprinkle generously with flaky sea salt. (Salt the tomatoes specifically).
    Drizzle the Extra Virgin Olive Oil liberally over the entire platter. You want enough oil to pool slightly at the bottom to mix with the tomato juices.
6. Serve
    Serve immediately with crusty bread to mop up the delicious oil-tomato-whey mixture (fare la scarpetta) left on the plate.
