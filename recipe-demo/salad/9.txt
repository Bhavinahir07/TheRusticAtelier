The Crunch:
    2 cups Green Papaya (Unripe), peeled and shredded/julienned
    ½ cup Long Beans (Snake Beans), cut into 1-inch lengths (Green beans are a fair substitute)
    6-8 Cherry Tomatoes, halved
    2 tbsp Roasted Peanuts
The Aromatics & Heat:
    2-3 cloves Garlic
    2-5 Thai Bird's Eye Chilies (Adjust strictly to tolerance - 2 is mild/medium, 5 is hot)
The Dressing (The 3 Flavors):
    1 ½ tbsp Palm Sugar (melted or chopped finely)
    2 tbsp Fish Sauce (Nam Pla)
    2-3 tbsp Lime Juice (freshly squeezed)
    1 tbsp Dried Shrimp (optional, but traditional)
    1 tsp Tamarind paste (optional, adds a deeper fruitier sourness)
Equipment:
    Large Clay or Wooden Mortar and Pestle (If unavailable, use a sturdy mixing bowl and a rolling pin/meat mallet).

1. Shred the Papaya (The Texture Step)
    Peel the green skin off the papaya.
    Traditional Method: Hold the papaya in one hand. Use a large knife to chop many vertical cuts into the flesh. Then, slice off the top layer to create thin, uneven shards. This creates the best texture.
    Easy Method: Use a julienne peeler (like a Kiwi brand peeler) to create uniform strips.
    Soak the shreds in ice water for 5 minutes to make them extra crunchy, then drain well.
2. Pound the Aromatics
    Place the garlic and chilies in the mortar.
    Pound vigorously until the garlic is crushed and the chilies are broken (but not pulverized into a curry paste).
    Note: If you want less heat, add chilies later or bruise them very gently.
3. Make the Dressing Base
    Add the palm sugar, fish sauce, lime juice, and tamarind (if using) to the mortar.
    Use the pestle to grind and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved and the liquid emulsifies.
    Taste Test: This is the most important step. It should be Sour, Salty, and Sweet in balance. Adjust now.
4. Bruise the Vegetables
    Add the dried shrimp and the long beans.
    Pound gently just to bruise the beans (they should crack open slightly).
    Add the cherry tomatoes and press them gently with the pestle to release some juice without smashing them completely.
5. The Toss (Tum)
    Add the shredded papaya and roasted peanuts.
    Technique: Use a spoon in one hand and the pestle in the other. Use the pestle to push and bruise the papaya while using the spoon to scoop and flip the mixture.
    Continue this "pound and flip" motion for about 1 minute. The papaya should soften slightly and absorb the dressing, but remain crunchy.
6. Serve
    Pour the salad (and all the liquid dressing) onto a plate.
    Serve immediately with sticky rice (to dip in the sauce) and grilled chicken (Gai Yang).
