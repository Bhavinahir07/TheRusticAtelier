The Vegetables:
    3 medium Potatoes (waxy variety like Yukon Gold holds shape best), unpeeled
    2 medium Carrots, unpeeled
    1 cup (150g) Green Peas (canned is traditional; chilled/thawed is brighter)
    3-4 Pickles (Salted/Dill pickles, not sweet), diced
    ½ small Onion, finely minced (optional, scallions are a milder alternative)
The Proteins:
    3-4 Hard-boiled Eggs
    ¾ lb (350g) Doctor's Sausage (Bologna), Ham, or Boiled Chicken Breast
The Dressing:
    ¾ cup (180g) Mayonnaise (full fat)
    1 tsp Mustard (optional, for kick)
    Salt and Black Pepper
    Fresh Dill, chopped (for garnish)

1. Boil the Root Vegetables
    Place the whole, unpeeled potatoes and carrots in a large pot of salted water.
    Bring to a boil and cook until tender when pierced with a knife (usually 20-25 minutes). Do not overcook them into mash.
    Technique: Boiling them in their skins ("in their uniforms") preserves their flavor and texture.
    Drain and let them cool completely to room temperature. (Chopping warm potatoes results in mush).
2. Boil the Eggs
    Hard boil the eggs (about 10 minutes). Cool in ice water, then peel.
3. The "Pea-Size" Dice (The Meditative Step)
    Once cooled, peel the potatoes and carrots.
    The Rule: Dice the potatoes, carrots, hard-boiled eggs, pickles, and meat into small cubes that are the same size as the peas.
    Place all the diced ingredients into a very large mixing bowl.
4. Prep the Peas and Onion
    If using canned peas, drain them very well. If using frozen, thaw and drain. Add to the bowl.
    Add the finely minced onion.
    Tip: If the onions are too sharp, pour boiling water over the chopped onions in a sieve, then rinse with cold water. This removes the harsh bite.
5. Mix and Dress
    Add the mayonnaise (and mustard, if using) to the bowl.
    Gently fold everything together until every cube is evenly coated in creamy dressing.
    Taste and season with salt and pepper. (Be careful with salt, as the pickles, mayo, and sausage are already salty).
6. Chill and Serve
    Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. This allows the flavors to meld and the potatoes to absorb some dressing.
    Serve chilled, garnished with fresh chopped dill.
