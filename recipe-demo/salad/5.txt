The Base:
    4 thick slices (approx. 10oz / 300g) Stale Country Bread (Sourdough or Ciabatta work well). It must be dry and hard.
    Water (for soaking)
    2 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar (for soaking)
The Fresh Mix:
    3-4 large, very ripe Tomatoes, cut into irregular chunks
    1 Cucumber, peeled and sliced into rounds
    ½ Red Onion, thinly sliced
    1 large bunch Fresh Basil, leaves torn
The Dressing:
    ½ cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Tuscan oil is peppery and green)
    2-3 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar (to taste)
    Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper

1. Mellow the Onions
    Place the thinly sliced red onions in a small bowl. Cover with water and a splash of vinegar.
    Let them soak for 15 minutes. This removes the harsh, raw bite and turns them sweet and crisp. Drain well before using.
2. The Bread Revival (The Authentic Step)
    Place the stale bread slices in a shallow dish. Mix the water with 2 tbsp of vinegar and pour it over the bread.
    Let it soak for about 10-15 minutes (depending on how hard the bread is) until it is softened through but not dissolving.
    Technique: Take the bread in your hands and squeeze it tightly to wring out almost all the liquid.
    Tear the squeezed bread into rough, bite-sized chunks into a large salad bowl. The texture should be moist and spongy, not wet.
3. Assemble the Salad
    Add the chopped tomatoes, cucumber slices, and drained red onions to the bowl with the bread.
    Tear the basil leaves generously over the top.
4. Dress and Toss
    Drizzle the olive oil and the remaining red wine vinegar over the salad.
    Season generously with salt and pepper.
    Toss everything together with your hands. The bread acts like a sponge, soaking up the tomato juices and the oil-vinegar emulsion.
5. The Essential Rest
    Do not serve immediately. Cover the bowl and let it sit at room temperature (or in the fridge if it's very hot) for at least 30 minutes.
    This resting period allows the flavors to marry and the bread to fully flavor-bond with the tomatoes.
6. Serve
    Give it one final toss. Taste and adjust seasoning (it often needs more vinegar or salt).
    Serve cool or at room temperature.
