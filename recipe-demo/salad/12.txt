The Solids:
    2 large Chicken Breasts (boneless, skinless), approx. 1 lb / 450g
    1 cup Red Grapes, halved (seedless)
    2 stalks Celery, finely diced
    ½ cup Pecans or Walnuts, toasted and roughly chopped
    ¼ cup Red Onion, finely minced (optional, for bite)
The Poaching Liquid (Aromatics):
    Water (enough to cover chicken)
    1 tsp Salt
    1 Bay Leaf
    5 Peppercorns
The Dressing:
    ½ cup Mayonnaise (classic full-fat is best)
    ¼ cup Sour Cream or Greek Yogurt (adds a necessary tang to cut the richness)
    1 tsp Dijon Mustard
    1 tbsp Fresh Lemon Juice
    1 tbsp Fresh Dill or Tarragon, chopped (these herbs pair perfectly with chicken)
    Salt and Black Pepper

1. Poach the Chicken (The Moisture Step)
    Place the chicken breasts in a pot. Add the salt, bay leaf, and peppercorns. Pour in enough cold water to cover the chicken by 1 inch.
    Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
    Technique: As soon as it boils, cover the pot with a lid and turn off the heat completely.
    Let the chicken sit in the hot water for 15-20 minutes. It will cook gently through residual heat, remaining incredibly moist and tender.
    Remove chicken and let it cool completely in the fridge.
2. Toast the Nuts
     chicken cools, toast the pecans in a dry skillet over medium heat for 3-5 minutes until fragrant. Let them cool.
3. The Chop
    Once the chicken is cold, cut it into ½-inch cubes.
    Note: Cubing is preferred over shredding for this style of salad, as it provides a better bite and prevents the salad from becoming "stringy."
4. Make the Dressing
    In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, fresh herbs (dill or tarragon), salt, and pepper.
5. Assemble
    Add the cubed chicken, diced celery, halved grapes, minced onion, and toasted pecans to the bowl with the dressing.
    Fold everything together gently with a rubber spatula until well coated.
6. Chill and Serve
    Crucial Step: Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. This allows the flavors to marry and the dressing to thicken slightly.
    Serve on croissants (the classic choice), toasted sourdough, or on a bed of butter lettuce.
