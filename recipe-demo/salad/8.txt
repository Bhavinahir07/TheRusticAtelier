The Wedge:
    1 head Iceberg Lettuce (dense and heavy for its size)
    ½ cup Cherry Tomatoes, halved
    4-6 strips Thick-Cut Bacon, cooked until shattering-crisp and crumbled
    2 tbsp Fresh Chives (or scallions), finely chopped
    Freshly cracked Black Pepper
The Blue Cheese Dressing:
    ½ cup (120g) Mayonnaise
    ½ cup (120g) Sour Cream (or Greek Yogurt)
    ¼ cup (60ml) Buttermilk (or milk)
    4 oz (115g) Blue Cheese (Roquefort, Gorgonzola, or Danish Blue), crumbled
    1 tbsp Lemon Juice or White Vinegar
    ½ tsp Worcestershire Sauce
    ½ tsp Garlic Powder

1. Prepare the Dressing (Ideally ahead of time)
    In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder.
    Stir in the buttermilk until you reach a pourable but thick consistency.
    Fold in the crumbled blue cheese. Mash some of the crumbles with a spoon to infuse flavor, but leave plenty of chunks for texture.
    Season with salt and plenty of black pepper. Refrigerate until serving.
2. Prepare the Lettuce (The Butcher)
    Remove the loose, wilting outer leaves of the iceberg head.
    Slam the core of the lettuce down on the counter to loosen it, then pull the core out (or cut it out with a knife).
    Cut the head in half through the stem end.
    Cut each half in half again to create 4 equal wedges.
    Tip: Rinse the wedges under very cold water to clean, then drain them cut-side down on paper towels. They must be bone dry before dressing, or the sauce will slide off. Chill in the fridge until the very last second.
3. Cook the Bacon
    Fry the bacon until it is deeply browned and extremely crispy. Drain on paper towels.
    Once cool, chop or crumble into bits.
4. Assembly
    Place each cold lettuce wedge on a chilled plate.
    Pour the dressing generously over the top of the wedge, allowing it to cascade down the sides and pool on the plate.
    Scatter the halved tomatoes and crispy bacon over the dressing (the dressing acts as glue).
5. Serve
    Garnish with fresh chives and a final aggressive crack of black pepper.
    Serve immediately with a steak knife and fork.
