The Base (Raw Vegetables):
    4-5 ripe, firm Tomatoes, cut into wedges
    1 small Cucumber, peeled and sliced into rounds
    1 cup Fava Beans (Broad beans), fresh and shelled (if unavailable, use raw peas or thinly sliced celery hearts)
    1 small Green Bell Pepper (or elongated salad pepper), seeded and sliced into thin rings
    3-4 Radishes, thinly sliced
    2-3 Spring Onions (Scallions), white and light green parts, thinly sliced
    2-3 raw Baby Artichokes (optional), outer leaves removed, sliced paper-thin (soaked in lemon water)
    1 clove Garlic, peeled and halved (for the bowl)
The Proteins:
    3-4 Hard-boiled Eggs, almost jammy (cooked ~8-9 mins), quartered
    1 can (7oz / 200g) high-quality Tuna packed in olive oil, drained and flaked
    8-10 Anchovy fillets in oil
The Garnish & Dressing:
    ½ cup Niçoise Olives (small, black, briny olives - Kalamata is a decent substitute)
    10-12 fresh Basil leaves, torn
    Extra Virgin Olive Oil (the highest quality you have)
    Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper

1. Prepare the Bowl (The Scent)
    Choose a wide, shallow serving bowl or platter.
    Rub the inside of the bowl vigorously with the cut sides of the garlic clove. Discard the garlic. This perfumes the dish subtly.
2. Salt the Tomatoes
    Place the tomato wedges in the bowl. Sprinkle them lightly with salt.
    Let them sit for 5 minutes. They will release some juice, which will mix with the olive oil later to create a natural dressing.
3. Prepare the Artichokes (If using)
    If using raw baby artichokes, trim them down to the pale, tender hearts. Slice them paper-thin.
    Tip: If you aren't serving immediately, toss them in a little lemon juice to prevent browning.
4. Compose the Salad (Do Not Toss Vigourously)
    Layer the cucumber rounds, green pepper rings, radishes, spring onions, and fava beans over the tomatoes.
    Niçoise is a "composed salad," meaning ingredients are often arranged artfully rather than tossed into a chaotic mess.
5. Add Proteins
    Flake the tuna chunks over the vegetables.
    Arrange the hard-boiled egg quarters and the anchovy fillets in a decorative pattern on top (often in a radial pattern like the spokes of a wheel).
6. Garnish and Dress
    Scatter the black olives and the torn fresh basil leaves over the top.
    Season generously with black pepper and a little more salt (be careful, as anchovies/olives are salty).
    The Dressing: Drizzle generously with Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
    Authenticity Note: Traditionalists often use only olive oil, letting the tomato juice provide the acid. However, you can add a tiny splash of red wine vinegar if you prefer more tang.
    Serve immediately with crusty baguette to soak up the juices.
