The Greens & Crunch:
    2 large heads Romaine Lettuce (Hearts only), washed, dried thoroughly, and torn into large bite-sized pieces
    ½ cup Freshly Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (plus more shaved for garnish)
The Homemade Croutons:
    3 cups crusty Bread (Baguette or Sourdough), torn or cut into 1-inch cubes
    3 tbsp Olive Oil
    1 clove Garlic, smashed
The Caesar Dressing (The Emulsion):
    1 large Egg Yolk (very fresh)*
    1 large clove Garlic, minced to a paste
    1 tbsp Lemon Juice (freshly squeezed)
    1 tsp Dijon Mustard
    2-3 dashes Worcestershire Sauce (The secret ingredient)
    ½ cup (120ml) Vegetable Oil or mild Olive Oil (Extra Virgin can be too bitter for the bulk of the dressing; a mix is best)
    2 Anchovy Fillets, mashed to a paste (Optional, for a punchier "modern" flavor)
    Salt and plenty of coarsely ground Black Pepper
*Note on Eggs: If concerned about raw egg yolks, use pasteurized eggs or coddle the egg (boil for 1 minute) before using.

1. Make the Garlic Croutons
    Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
    In a small bowl, mix the 3 tbsp olive oil with the smashed garlic clove. Let it sit for 10 minutes to infuse, then remove the garlic.
    Toss the bread cubes with the garlic oil, salt, and pepper on a baking sheet.
    Bake for 10-12 minutes, turning once, until golden brown and crunchy. Let cool.
2. Prepare the Bowl (The Garlic Paste)
    Use a very large wooden bowl (traditional).
    Place the minced garlic (and anchovies, if using) in the bottom of the bowl.
    Use the back of a fork to mash them against the wood with a pinch of coarse salt until it forms a gritty paste.
3. Build the Base
    Whisk the Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and lemon juice into the garlic paste.
    Add the Egg Yolk. Whisk vigorously until the mixture is creamy and pale yellow.
4. Create the Emulsion
    Crucial Step: While whisking constantly, add the oil drop by drop at first, then in a very slow, thin stream.
    As you whisk, the mixture will thicken and turn creamy, looking like a loose mayonnaise.
    Tip: If it looks oily or separated, stop adding oil and whisk harder until it comes back together.
5. Season the Dressing
    Stir in the ½ cup of grated Parmesan cheese and a generous amount of cracked black pepper.
    Taste. It should be tangy, salty, and savory. Add more lemon if it feels too heavy.
6. The Toss
    Add the dry Romaine leaves to the bowl on top of the dressing.
    Technique: Use salad tongs (or clean hands) to toss the lettuce. You must toss for at least 30-60 seconds. Every single leaf should be coated in the creamy emulsion.
    Add the croutons and toss gently one last time.
7. Serve
    Top with extra shavings of Parmesan cheese and more black pepper.
    Serve immediately while the croutons are crisp and the lettuce is cold.
