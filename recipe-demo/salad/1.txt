The Vegetables:
    3-4 large, ripe Tomatoes (Vine-ripened or Heirloom are best), cut into large wedges
    1 large Cucumber (English/Persian preferred, peeled if skin is thick), sliced into thick rounds or half-moons
    1 small Red Onion, sliced into thin rings or half-moons
    1 Green Bell Pepper (or Cubanelle pepper), seeded and sliced into rings or strips
    ½ cup Kalamata Olives, whole (pits in keeps them firmer, but pitted is easier to eat)
The Crown & Dressing:
    1 large block (approx. 7oz / 200g) Greek Feta Cheese (Sheep/Goat milk blend is best)
    ⅓ cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Use your best quality oil here)
    1-2 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar
    1 tbsp Dried Greek Oregano (Rigani)
    Sea Salt (to taste)
    Optional: 1 tbsp Capers (common in island versions)

1. Prepare the Vegetables
    Wash all vegetables thoroughly.
    Tomatoes: Cut the tomatoes into large, irregular wedges. Do not dice them; you want substantial, juicy chunks. Place them in a large, wide serving bowl.
    Cucumber: Slice the cucumber into ¼-inch thick rounds. Add to the bowl.
    Peppers & Onions: Add the green pepper slices and the red onion rings.
    Tip: If your red onions are very sharp, you can soak the slices in ice water for 10 minutes to mellow them out, then drain well before adding.
2. Season the Base
    Add the Kalamata olives (and capers, if using) to the bowl.
    Sprinkle the vegetables lightly with sea salt.
    Caution: Be conservative with the salt, as the olives and the feta cheese are essentially brine-cured and very salty.
3. The Dressing (Direct Method)
    Drizzle the Red Wine Vinegar over the vegetables.
    Pour the Extra Virgin Olive Oil generously over everything.
    Gently toss the vegetables once to coat them in the oil and vinegar. Do not over-mix, or the tomatoes will break down too much.
4. The Crowning of the Feta
    Authentic Presentation: Do not crumble the feta. Place the whole block (or large rectangular slabs) directly on top of the salad.
    Drizzle a little more olive oil specifically over the cheese.
    Rub the dried oregano between your palms to crush it and sprinkle it generously over the feta and the salad.
5. Serve
    Serve immediately at room temperature.
    Crucial Accompaniment: Serve with crusty village bread. The best part of a Horiatiki is the Papara—dipping the bread into the mixture of tomato juice, olive oil, and feta crumbs left at the bottom of the bowl.
