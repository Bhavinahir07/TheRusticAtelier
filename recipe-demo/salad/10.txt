The Greens (The Base):
    4-5 large bunches Flat-Leaf (Italian) Parsley (Curly parsley is rarely used in authentic recipes)
    ½ cup Fresh Mint leaves
The Grain & Veg:
    ¼ cup Fine Bulgur (#1 Fine Grind). Do not use coarse bulgur.
    3-4 firm, ripe Tomatoes (Roma or vine), diced very small
    3-4 Green Onions (Scallions), white and green parts, finely sliced
The Dressing:
    ½ cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Premium quality)
    ½ cup Fresh Lemon Juice (from ~3-4 lemons)
    Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper
    ½ tsp Baharat (7-Spice) or Allspice (optional, but authentic for depth)
    Pinch of Cinnamon (optional)
For Serving:
    Romaine Lettuce leaves or Cabbage leaves (used as edible scoops)

1. Prepare the Bulgur (The Soak)
    Rinse the fine bulgur briefly in a fine-mesh sieve.
    Place it in a small bowl.
    Authentic Technique: Pour the fresh lemon juice over the bulgur. Let it soak in the juice while you chop the vegetables. This softens the grain and infuses it with flavor. (If the grain is still hard after 20 minutes, add a splash of tomato juice or water).
2. The "Dry Chop" (Crucial Step)
    Wash the parsley and mint thoroughly.
    Dry them completely. Use a salad spinner, then lay them out on kitchen towels. The leaves must be bone dry. If they are wet, the salad will be soggy.
    Pick the leaves from the stems (discard thick stems).
    Bunch the leaves into a tight ball and slice them very finely with a sharp knife.
    Rule: Chop once. Do not run your knife over the pile repeatedly (like mincing garlic), or you will bruise the herbs and turn them into black mush.
3. Chop Vegetables
    Dice the tomatoes into tiny cubes (smaller than the bulgur grains if possible).
    Slice the green onions as thinly as possible.
4. Assemble
    In a large mixing bowl, add the chopped parsley, mint, tomatoes, and green onions.
    Add the soaked bulgur (and any remaining lemon juice in the bowl).
    Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and the optional spices (Baharat/Cinnamon).
5. Dress and Serve
    Pour the olive oil over the salad.
    Toss gently but thoroughly until the parsley glistens.
    Taste and adjust: Tabbouleh should be very lemony and tart. Add more lemon juice if needed.
    Serve immediately with crisp romaine lettuce leaves or cabbage leaves to scoop up the salad.
