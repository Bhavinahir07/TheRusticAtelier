The "Holy Trinity" & Fruit:
    2 large Crisp Apples (Granny Smith for tartness, or Honeycrisp for sweet-tart), cored and cubed (leave skin on for color)
    1 cup Celery (about 2 stalks), sliced thinly or diced
    1 cup Grapes (Red or Green), halved (seedless)
    1 cup Walnut Halves, toasted and roughly chopped
The Dressing:
    ½ cup (120g) Mayonnaise
    1 tbsp Fresh Lemon Juice
    ½ tsp Sugar (optional, balances the tartness)
    Pinch of Salt
    Freshly Ground Black Pepper
For Serving:
    Bibb or Butter Lettuce leaves (the traditional "cup")

1. Toast the Walnuts (Flavor Booster)
    Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) or use a dry skillet.
    Toast the walnut halves for 5-7 minutes until fragrant. Watch closely so they don't burn.
    Let them cool completely. (Warm nuts will melt the mayo).
2. Prep the Apples
    Wash and core the apples. Cut them into ½-inch cubes.
    Crucial Step: Place the apple cubes in a large bowl and toss immediately with the lemon juice. This prevents browning and adds necessary acidity to the salad.
3. Assemble the Base
    Add the sliced celery and the halved grapes to the bowl with the apples.
    Add the cooled, chopped walnuts.
4. Dress the Salad
    Add the mayonnaise, sugar, salt, and a crack of black pepper directly to the bowl (or whisk separately if you prefer).
    The Toss: Gently fold everything together with a spatula until the fruit and nuts are evenly coated in a thin, creamy layer.
    Tip: If the dressing feels too heavy, you can thin it with a teaspoon of milk or heavy cream for a lighter consistency.
5. Chill and Serve
    Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to let the flavors meld and the salad chill (Waldorf is best served very cold).
    To serve, place a few leaves of butter lettuce on plates or in bowls. Scoop the salad into the lettuce cups.
    Garnish with a few extra walnut pieces or celery leaves.
