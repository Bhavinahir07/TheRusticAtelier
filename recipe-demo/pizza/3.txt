For the NY-style pizza dough (makes two 14-inch pizzas):
    3 ¾ cups (450g) high-gluten bread flour
    1 ½ cups (355ml) lukewarm water
    1 ½ tsp fine sea salt
    1 tsp instant yeast
    1 tsp granulated sugar
    1 tbsp olive oil
For the cooked pizza sauce:
    1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes
    2 tbsp olive oil
    2 cloves garlic, smashed
    1 tsp dried oregano
    ½ tsp salt
    Pinch of sugar
For the toppings:
    1 lb low-moisture, whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded
    Optional: pepperoni slices, grated Parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes

1. Create the Foundation Dough (Day 1)

    In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the bread flour, salt, instant yeast, and sugar.

    With the mixer on low, slowly stream in the lukewarm water and olive oil. Mix for 2-3 minutes until a cohesive dough forms. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 5-7 minutes, until the dough is very smooth and elastic.

    Tip: A proper NY dough should be slightly tacky but not sticky. If it's too sticky, add flour one tablespoon at a time. The high gluten in bread flour is essential for the characteristic chew.

2. The Critical Cold Ferment

    Divide the dough in half and form each piece into a tight ball. Place each dough ball into a separate oiled bowl or a large zip-top bag.

    Seal the containers and place them in the refrigerator to cold-ferment for at least 24 hours, and up to 72 hours.

    Comment: This slow, cold fermentation is the secret to developing the rich, complex flavor of a genuine pizzeria crust. It cannot be rushed.

3. Prepare the Cooked Sauce

    While the dough ferments, make the sauce. Pour the olive oil into a saucepan over medium heat. Add the smashed garlic cloves and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, but not browned.

    Add the entire can of tomatoes, crushing them with a spoon. Stir in the oregano, salt, and a pinch of sugar.

    Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, until it has thickened slightly. Remove the garlic cloves and let the sauce cool completely.

4. Final Proof and Oven Preparation (Day 2)

    About 2-3 hours before you plan to bake, remove the dough from the refrigerator. Place it on a lightly floured surface, cover it with a towel, and let it come to room temperature.

    Place a pizza stone or steel on an oven rack in the upper third of your oven. Preheat the oven to its highest possible temperature, typically 550°F (285°C), for at least one full hour.

5. Hand-Stretch the Pizza

    Take one ball of room-temperature dough and place it on a well-floured surface.

    Using your fingertips, press the dough into a flat circle, leaving the outer 1-inch rim thicker.

    Pick up the dough and drape it over the backs of your hands. Gently stretch and rotate the dough, letting gravity help pull it into a large, thin circle (about 14 inches). Avoid touching the outer rim to keep it puffy.

6. Assemble the Pie

    Lay the stretched dough onto a pizza peel that has been generously dusted with cornmeal or semolina flour.

    Spread a thin, even layer of the cooled sauce over the dough, leaving the outer rim bare.

    Generously and evenly cover the sauce with the shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese.

    Comment: Low-moisture mozzarella is non-negotiable for a NY slice. Fresh mozzarella will release too much water and create a soggy pizza.

7. Launch and Bake

    Give the peel a gentle shake to ensure the pizza is not stuck.

    Open the oven and, in one quick motion, slide the pizza from the peel onto the preheated stone or steel.

    Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is a deep golden-brown and the cheese is melted and bubbling with some browned spots.

8. Slice and Serve

    Use the peel to retrieve the pizza from the oven and transfer it to a cutting board.

    Let it rest for a minute before slicing it into large, wide wedges. Serve immediately.

    Tip: The ultimate test of a good NY slice is the "fold." You should be able to fold your slice in half lengthwise without the crust cracking or the toppings sliding off.
