For the Greek pizza dough (makes two 10-inch pizzas):
    3 cups bread flour
    1 ½ tsp instant yeast
    1 tsp salt
    1 tsp sugar
    1 cup warm water
    ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil (plus more for pans)
For the herbed tomato sauce:
    1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
    1 tbsp olive oil
    1 ½ tsp dried oregano
    ½ tsp garlic powder
    ½ tsp salt
    Pinch of sugar
For the toppings:
    8 ounces low-moisture mozzarella, shredded
    4 ounces sharp white cheddar cheese, shredded
    Optional: feta cheese, Kalamata olives, sliced red onion, spinach, green bell peppers

1. Create the Dough

    In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the bread flour, instant yeast, salt, and sugar.

    Pour in the warm water and olive oil. Mix with a spatula until a cohesive, sticky dough forms.

    Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.

    Comment: This dough is enriched with a significant amount of olive oil, which is key to achieving the tender, flavorful crumb characteristic of the Greek style.

2. First Rise and Pan Prep

    Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it, and let it rise in a warm spot for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.

    While the dough rises, generously coat two 10-inch round metal cake pans or deep-dish pizza pans with olive oil.

    Tip: The oil in the pan is not just for preventing sticking; it's a crucial ingredient that fries the bottom of the crust, making it uniquely crispy and golden.

3. Shape and Proof in the Pan

    Divide the risen dough in half. Place each half in the center of an oiled pan.

    With oiled fingers, gently press and stretch each dough portion to fill the bottom of its pan.

    Cover the pans and let the dough rise again, right in the pans, for another 30-60 minutes, until it becomes visibly puffy.

4. Prepare Sauce and Oven

    While the dough proofs in the pans, combine all the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly.

    Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 450°F (232°C).

5. Assemble the Pizza

    Once the dough is puffy, spread the prepared sauce evenly over each crust, going almost to the edge.

    Toss the shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheeses together in a bowl.

    Sprinkle the cheese blend generously over the sauce, making sure to spread it all the way to the very edges of the pan.

    Comment: Pushing the cheese to the edge is a defining feature of Greek pizza. The cheese will melt down the sides and create a crispy, browned, delicious border.

6. Bake the Pan Pizza

    Add any additional toppings like feta, olives, or onions over the cheese.

    Carefully place the pans in the preheated oven.

    Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the cheese is deeply golden and bubbly and the edges are dark and crisp.

7. Serve the Pizza

    Using a spatula, carefully remove the pizzas from the hot pans and transfer them to a cutting board.

    Let them rest for a few minutes before slicing into wedges and serving.
