For the pizza dough:
    2 ½ cups all-purpose flour (or bread flour for a chewier crust)
    1 ½ tsp instant yeast
    1 tsp granulated sugar
    1 tsp salt
    1 cup warm water (around 110°F or 43°C)
    2 tbsp olive oil (plus more for the pan)
For the simple tomato sauce:
    1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
    2 cloves garlic (minced)
    1 tsp dried oregano
    ½ tsp salt
    Pinch of red pepper flakes
For the toppings:
    8 oz low-moisture mozzarella cheese (sliced or shredded)
    ½ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
    Optional toppings: sliced pepperoni, sautéed onions, anchovies

1. Prepare the Dough

    In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt.

    Pour in the warm water and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Mix with a sturdy spoon or spatula until a shaggy dough forms and no dry flour remains.

    Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a warm spot for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

    Comment: This is a no-knead dough. The long, slow rise develops the gluten and flavor without the work of kneading, resulting in the characteristic light and airy crumb.

2. Ready the Baking Pan

    Pour a generous ¼ cup of olive oil into a 9x13 inch baking pan. Use your hands to spread the oil evenly across the bottom and up the sides.

    Tip: Do not be shy with the olive oil. This is what gives the Sicilian pizza its signature crispy, golden, and deliciously fried bottom crust. It is essential to the final texture.

3. Shape the Crust

    Once the dough has risen, gently scrape it out of the bowl and into the center of the oiled pan.

    Using oiled fingertips, gently press and stretch the dough towards the corners of the pan. It will resist and shrink back.

    Cover the pan and let the dough relax for 15-20 minutes. After resting, it will be much easier to stretch. Uncover and finish pressing the dough to fill the entire pan.

4. Final Rise and Oven Prep

    Cover the pan again and let the dough rise for another 30-45 minutes until it looks puffy.

    While it rises, position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 425°F (220°C).

    In a small bowl, stir together all the ingredients for the tomato sauce.

5. Par-Bake the Crust

    Uncover the puffy dough and use your fingertips to dimple the surface, similar to making focaccia.

    Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, just until the crust is lightly golden.

    Comment: Par-baking the crust before adding toppings is a crucial step. It ensures the thick dough cooks through completely and prevents the center from being gummy.

6. Assemble and Bake the Pizza

    Remove the pan from the oven. Layer the toppings in the traditional Sicilian order: first the Pecorino Romano cheese, then the slices of mozzarella.

    Spoon the tomato sauce over the cheese in dollops or stripes, not covering it completely. Add any other toppings you desire.

    Return the pizza to the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the edges of the crust are deep golden brown.

7. Finish and Serve

    Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven. Let the pizza cool in the pan for about 5 minutes.

    Use a large spatula to lift the pizza out of the pan and onto a cutting board.

    Slice into squares and serve immediately.
