For the high-hydration dough:
    2 ¼ cups (300g) bread flour
    1 ½ tsp instant yeast
    1 ½ tsp fine sea salt
    1 cup (235ml) warm water
    1 tbsp olive oil
For the toppings:
    8 ounces Wisconsin brick cheese (cubed)
    4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella (cubed)
    3-4 ounces thick-cut pepperoni slices
For the "Red Top" sauce:
    1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
    1 tsp granulated sugar
    1 tsp dried oregano
    ½ tsp garlic powder
    ½ tsp salt

1. Form the Dough

    In a large bowl, whisk together the bread flour, instant yeast, and salt.

    Add the warm water and olive oil. Mix with a spatula until a wet, shaggy dough forms and all the flour is hydrated.

    Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes to allow the flour to absorb the water.

    After resting, perform a few "stretch and folds": with wet hands, grab a portion of the dough, stretch it upwards, and fold it over the center. Rotate the bowl and repeat 3-4 times.

2. The Primary Fermentation

    Cover the bowl again and let the dough rise in a warm place for 2 to 2.5 hours, or until it has at least doubled in size and is full of bubbles.

    Comment: This is a high-hydration dough, which means it will be very sticky. This is necessary for the light, airy, and chewy interior crust that contrasts with the crispy bottom.

3. Pan Preparation and Final Proof

    Coat a 10x14 inch Detroit-style pizza pan or a 9x13 inch deep-sided metal baking pan with 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil.

    Gently scrape the risen dough into the prepared pan. With oiled hands, gently press and stretch the dough to cover the bottom of the pan. If it springs back, cover it and let it relax for 15 minutes before trying again.

    Cover the pan and let the dough proof for 30-45 minutes until it becomes puffy.

    While it proofs, preheat your oven to its highest setting, typically 550°F (285°C), with a rack in the lower third.

4. Prepare Toppings and Sauce

    Cut the Wisconsin brick cheese and mozzarella into small, ½-inch cubes.

    In a small saucepan, combine all the sauce ingredients. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes until slightly thickened. Keep the sauce warm.

    Tip: The traditional cheese for this pizza is Wisconsin brick cheese due to its buttery flavor and perfect melting quality. If you cannot find it, a combination of low-moisture mozzarella and Monterey Jack is a good substitute.

5. Assemble the Pizza

    Once the dough is puffy, arrange the pepperoni slices in a single layer over the surface.

    Evenly distribute the cubed cheese over the pizza, making sure to push the cheese all the way to the very edges of the pan so it touches the sides.

    Comment: This is the most important step for an authentic Detroit pizza. The cheese that touches the hot metal of the pan will melt, fry, and create the legendary crispy, caramelized "frico" crust.

6. Bake the Pizza

    Place the pan in the fiercely hot oven on the lower rack.

    Bake for 12-15 minutes. The pizza is done when the crust is deep golden brown on the bottom and the cheese on the edges has turned into a dark, lacy, crispy wall.

7. Top with Sauce and Serve

    Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven. Immediately use a thin metal spatula to loosen the pizza and slide it from the pan onto a wire rack.

    Ladle two or three wide stripes of the warm "red top" sauce over the pizza.

    Let the pizza rest for a minute, then slice it into squares and serve immediately.
