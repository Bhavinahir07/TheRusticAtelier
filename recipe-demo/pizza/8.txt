For the Neapolitan-style dough (makes 4 pizza bases):
    500g "Tipo 00" flour (plus more for dusting)
    325ml cool water
    10g fine sea salt
    1g instant yeast
    Semolina or all-purpose flour for dusting the peel
For the Margherita toppings (per pizza):
    ¼ cup canned San Marzano tomatoes, whole
    Pinch of fine sea salt
    4 ounces fresh, high-quality mozzarella di bufala or fior di latte
    A handful of fresh basil leaves
    1 to 2 tbsp high-quality extra virgin olive oil

1. Prepare the Oven and Ingredients

    Place a pizza stone or steel on an upper rack in your oven. Preheat the oven to its absolute highest temperature (550°F / 290°C) for at least one hour to fully heat the stone.

    Drain the fresh mozzarella and tear it into rustic, 1-inch pieces. Gently pat the pieces with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.

    Comment: Removing excess water from the mozzarella is a critical step. It prevents the pizza from becoming soggy and ensures the cheese melts into creamy pools rather than a watery mess.

2. Create the Pure Tomato Sauce

    Pour the whole San Marzano tomatoes into a bowl. Add a pinch of sea salt.

    Crush the tomatoes by hand until they break down into a simple, chunky sauce. Do not use a blender.

    Tip: A true Margherita sauce is uncooked and minimalist to let the sweet, vibrant flavor of the San Marzano tomatoes shine. Blending can incorporate air and dull the flavor.

3. Shape the Dough

    Take one ball of fully-proofed, room-temperature dough and place it on a well-floured surface.

    Using only your fingertips, gently press down in the center, working your way outwards while leaving the outer 1-inch rim completely untouched. This action pushes air into the rim, which will become the puffy cornicione.

    Lift the dough and, draping it over your knuckles, gently stretch and rotate it until it forms a thin, 10- to 12-inch circle. Never use a rolling pin, as it would destroy the delicate air pockets.

4. Assemble the Pizza

    Lightly dust a pizza peel with semolina or flour and lay your shaped dough on top.

    Spoon about 3-4 tablespoons of the hand-crushed tomato sauce onto the center of the dough and use the back of the spoon to spread it in a spiral motion, leaving the rim bare.

    Scatter the torn pieces of mozzarella evenly across the sauce.

    Drizzle the entire surface of the pizza with a spiral of high-quality extra virgin olive oil.

5. Bake Hot and Fast

    Gently shake the peel to ensure the pizza moves freely. In one swift motion, slide the pizza from the peel onto the preheated stone in the oven.

    Bake for 5-10 minutes (time will vary depending on your oven's max temperature), rotating halfway through if needed. The pizza is done when the crust is puffed and has charred spots, and the cheese is fully melted and bubbling.

6. The Final, Crucial Step

    Use the peel to remove the pizza from the oven and transfer it to a cutting board.

    Immediately scatter the fresh basil leaves over the hot pizza.

    Comment: Adding the basil after baking is essential. The heat from the pizza will wilt the leaves perfectly and release their fresh, aromatic oils without burning them, which would make them bitter.

7. Serve Immediately

    Let the pizza rest for no more than a minute. Slice and serve immediately. A Margherita pizza is best enjoyed piping hot, often with a knife and fork, in true Neapolitan style.
