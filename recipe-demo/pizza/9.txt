For the all-purpose pizza dough (makes two 12-inch pizzas):
    3 ½ cups (420g) all-purpose or bread flour
    2 ¼ tsp instant yeast
    1 ½ tsp salt
    1 tsp sugar
    1 ⅓ cups warm water
    2 tbsp olive oil
For the sauce and cheese:
    1 cup classic pizza sauce (cooked or uncooked)
    12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded
For the vegetable toppings (use any combination):
    1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
    1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
    1 small red onion, thinly sliced
    4 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
    ½ cup black olives, sliced
    1 cup fresh spinach
    1 small zucchini, thinly sliced
    Other options: broccoli florets, artichoke hearts, cherry tomatoes

1. Prepare the Dough

    In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, instant yeast, salt, and sugar.

    Add the warm water and olive oil. Mix with a spoon until a shaggy dough forms.

    Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 6-8 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Place it in an oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.

2. Pre-cook the Vegetables

    While the dough rises, prepare your toppings. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

    Sauté the mushrooms until they have released their liquid and started to brown. Remove them from the pan.

    In the same skillet, sauté the bell peppers and onions for 3-4 minutes until they are slightly softened but still have a bit of crunch.

    For spinach, wilt it in the hot pan for 1-2 minutes, then squeeze out as much excess water as possible.

    Comment: This is the most critical step for a great veggie pizza. Pre-cooking high-moisture vegetables prevents them from making the crust soggy during the final bake.

3. Set Up the Oven

    Place a pizza stone or steel in the oven and preheat to 475°F (245°C) for at least 45 minutes to an hour to ensure it's thoroughly heated.

4. Shape the Crust

    Gently punch down the risen dough and divide it in half.

    On a lightly floured surface, gently press and stretch one ball of dough into a 12-inch circle, leaving the outer rim slightly thicker.

5. Assemble the Pizza with Care

    Lay the shaped dough on a pizza peel dusted with cornmeal.

    Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border.

    Sprinkle about half of the shredded mozzarella directly over the sauce.

    Tip: This layer of cheese acts as a moisture barrier between the sauce and the vegetable toppings, providing extra insurance against a soggy crust.

    Evenly distribute your pre-cooked vegetables and any other toppings (like olives) over the cheese.

    Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella over the top of the vegetables.

6. Bake the Pizza

    In one quick motion, slide the assembled pizza from the peel onto the hot stone in the oven.

    Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the crust is deep golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

7. Rest and Serve

    Use the peel to remove the pizza from the oven and transfer it to a cutting board.

    Let the pizza rest for 3-5 minutes before slicing. This allows the cheese and toppings to set, making for cleaner slices.

    Slice and serve immediately.
