For the Neapolitan-style dough (makes 2 pizza bases):
    500g "Tipo 00" flour
    325ml cool water
    10g fine sea salt
    1g instant yeast
    Semolina flour for dusting
For the toppings (per pizza):
    ⅓ cup simple tomato sauce (uncooked, crushed San Marzano tomatoes)
    4 ounces fresh, low-moisture mozzarella, thinly sliced or torn
    4 ounces cremini or button mushrooms, thinly sliced
    3 ounces high-quality prosciutto cotto (Italian cooked ham), thinly sliced
    1 tbsp olive oil
    1 clove garlic, minced
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper
    Optional: fresh parsley, chopped

1. Prepare the Dough

    Follow the instructions for a long, cold-ferment Neapolitan-style dough. This involves mixing the flour, water, salt, and yeast, kneading until smooth, and allowing a long fermentation period (24-48 hours) in the refrigerator for optimal flavor and texture.

    About 2-3 hours before baking, remove the dough from the refrigerator, divide it, and let the dough balls come to room temperature.

2. Sauté the Mushrooms

    Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they have released their water and begin to brown and caramelize, about 5-7 minutes.

    Add the minced garlic and cook for one more minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.

    Comment: This step is essential. Cooking the mushrooms first concentrates their flavor and prevents them from releasing excess moisture onto the pizza, which would create a soggy crust.

3. Set Up the Baking Environment

    Place a pizza stone or steel on an upper rack in your oven. Preheat the oven to its highest temperature (550°F / 290°C) for at least 45 minutes to an hour. A thoroughly heated surface is key to a crisp crust.

4. Shape and Assemble the Pizza

    On a floured surface, gently stretch one ball of dough into a 12-inch circle, keeping the outer rim slightly thicker. Use your fingertips, not a rolling pin.

    Lay the stretched dough on a pizza peel dusted with semolina flour.

    Spread a thin, even layer of the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving the rim bare.

    Arrange the slices of fresh mozzarella over the sauce.

    Evenly distribute the sautéed mushrooms over the cheese, followed by the slices of prosciutto cotto.

5. Bake the Pizza

    In one swift, confident motion, slide the pizza from the peel onto the hot stone in the oven.

    Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is puffed and golden with some charred spots, and the cheese is completely melted and bubbling.

6. Garnish and Serve

    Use the peel to carefully remove the pizza from the oven and transfer it to a cutting board.

    Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley for a touch of freshness, if desired.

    Tip: For a different flavor profile, you can use prosciutto crudo (like Parma ham) instead. In this case, add the thin slices of prosciutto after the pizza comes out of the oven. The residual heat will warm it perfectly without making it tough.

7. Slice and Enjoy

    Let the pizza rest for a minute or two before slicing into wedges. Serve immediately.
