For the long-ferment dough (makes 4 pizzas):
    500g "Tipo 00" flour (plus more for dusting)
    325ml cool water
    10g fine sea salt
    1g instant yeast
For the classic Margherita topping (per pizza):
    ¼ cup crushed San Marzano tomatoes
    Pinch of sea salt
    3-4 ounces fresh mozzarella di bufala or fior di latte (torn into pieces and patted dry)
    4-5 fresh basil leaves
    1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

1. Begin the Dough (Day 1)

    In a large bowl, dissolve the sea salt into the cool water. In a separate, smaller bowl, whisk the instant yeast into the "Tipo 00" flour.

    Gradually add the flour mixture to the salt water, mixing with your hands or a wooden spoon until a cohesive, shaggy dough is formed.

    Tip: Keeping the yeast and salt from making direct, prolonged contact initially is a classic Neapolitan technique said to protect the yeast's vitality.

2. Develop the Gluten

    Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand for 15-20 minutes. The dough will start sticky but will become smooth, elastic, and supple.

    Form the dough into a single large ball. Place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 2 hours.

3. The Cold Fermentation

    After the initial 2-hour rise, place the covered bowl of dough into the refrigerator for a long, slow cold ferment. This should last a minimum of 24 hours and can go up to 72 hours.

    Comment: This slow fermentation is the most critical step for developing the complex, delicious flavor and perfect texture of the Neapolitan crust. Do not skip this.

4. Portion and Final Rise (Day 2)

    Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Divide it into four equal portions (around 215g each).

    Shape each portion into a tight, smooth ball. Place the dough balls on a lightly floured tray, cover them with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let them rise at room temperature for 4-6 hours, until they are soft and puffy.

5. Prepare Oven and Toppings

    Place a pizza stone or steel on the top rack of your oven. Preheat the oven to its absolute highest temperature (550°F / 290°C or higher) for at least one hour.

    For the sauce, simply hand-crush the San Marzano tomatoes with a pinch of salt. That's it.

    Comment: Authentic Neapolitan sauce is never cooked before it goes on the pizza. The goal is to taste the pure, bright flavor of the high-quality tomatoes.

6. Shape the Pizza

    Take one dough ball and place it on a well-floured surface. Using only your fingertips, gently press down in the center of the dough, leaving the outer 1-inch edge untouched.

    Carefully stretch the dough from the center outwards, continuously rotating it, until you have a thin base (about 10-12 inches) with a noticeably puffy, untouched rim—the cornicione. Never use a rolling pin.

7. Top and Bake

    Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour. Gently transfer your shaped dough onto the peel.

    Working quickly, spread the crushed tomatoes over the center, leaving the cornicione bare. Scatter the torn mozzarella pieces, add the fresh basil leaves, and finish with a spiral drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

    Slide the pizza from the peel onto the preheated stone or steel. Bake for 5-7 minutes, until the crust is puffed and charred in spots (leopard-spotting) and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

8. Serve Immediately

    Use the peel to remove the pizza from the oven.

    Tip: A true Neapolitan pizza is incredibly soft and best eaten with a knife and fork, or by folding the slice. It should be served immediately after it comes out of the oven.
