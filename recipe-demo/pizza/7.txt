For the cracker crust (no-yeast):
    2 cups all-purpose flour
    2 tsp baking powder
    1 tsp sugar
    ½ tsp salt
    ⅔ cup water
    2 tbsp olive oil
For the sweet St. Louis sauce:
    1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
    2 tbsp tomato paste
    1 tbsp sugar
    1 tsp dried oregano
    ½ tsp dried basil
    ¼ tsp garlic powder
For the toppings:
    12 ounces Provel cheese, shredded or cubed
    Optional: thinly sliced pepperoni, cooked Italian sausage, sliced onion

1. Prepare the Unleavened Crust

    In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.

    Add the water and olive oil, and stir with a spatula until a stiff, cohesive dough forms.

    Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly for about 1-2 minutes until it comes together smoothly.

    Cover the dough with a towel and let it rest for 10 minutes.

    Comment: This is not a yeast dough, so it does not need to rise. The short rest simply allows the flour to hydrate, making the dough easier to roll out.

2. Set Up the Oven

    Place a pizza stone or an inverted baking sheet on the middle rack of your oven.

    Preheat the oven to a high temperature, around 450°F (232°C). A hot surface is critical for achieving the cracker-like crispness.

3. Roll the Dough Paper-Thin

    Divide the rested dough in half. Working with one half at a time, place it on a large sheet of parchment paper.

    Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a very thin circle or rectangle, about 12-14 inches in diameter. Strive for it to be almost transparently thin.

    Tip: The goal is an ultra-thin, uniform crust with no puffy edge. Roll from the center out, applying even pressure to get it as thin as possible without tearing. The parchment paper will make it easy to transfer the fragile crust.

4. Mix the Sweet Sauce

    In a small bowl, whisk together all the sauce ingredients: tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, oregano, basil, and garlic powder. The sauce should be noticeably sweet and herbaceous.

5. Assemble the Pizza

    Spread a very thin layer of the sweet sauce over the rolled-out dough, leaving almost no border. The toppings on a St. Louis pizza go right to the edge.

    Generously and evenly distribute the Provel cheese over the sauce.

    Add your desired toppings, like pepperoni, spreading them evenly across the entire surface.

    Comment: Provel is the signature cheese. It doesn't stretch like mozzarella but melts into a unique, gooey, and creamy layer. If you can't find it, a mix of shredded provolone, white cheddar, and Swiss is the closest substitute.

6. Bake for a Crisp Finish

    Carefully slide the parchment paper with the assembled pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.

    Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the cheese is fully melted and bubbly, and the very edge of the crust is golden brown and visibly crisp.

7. The Signature "Tavern Cut"

    Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for just a minute.

    Using a pizza cutter, slice the pizza into small squares, about 2-3 inches wide. This is known as the "party cut" or "tavern cut."

    Tip: Because the crust is so brittle, it shatters when cut. The square cut makes for manageable, two-bite pieces and is an essential part of the St. Louis experience. Serve immediately.
