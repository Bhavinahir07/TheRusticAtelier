For the sturdy pizza dough (makes two 12-inch pizzas):
    3 ½ cups (420g) bread flour
    2 ¼ tsp instant yeast
    1 ½ tsp salt
    1 tsp sugar
    1 ⅓ cups warm water
    2 tbsp olive oil
For the sauce and cheese:
    1 cup classic pizza sauce
    12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded
For the meat toppings (per pizza):
    ¼ lb bulk Italian sausage
    3 strips of bacon, diced
    2 ounces pepperoni slices
    Optional: ½ lb ground beef, cooked and drained

1. Cultivate the Dough

    In a large bowl, whisk together the bread flour, instant yeast, salt, and sugar. Add the warm water and olive oil, mixing until a cohesive dough forms.

    Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 7-8 minutes until it is smooth, elastic, and supple.

    Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm spot for about 1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

2. Prepare the Meat Toppings

    While the dough rises, cook the raw meats. Place the diced bacon in a cold skillet and cook over medium heat until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and drain it on a paper towel-lined plate.

    In the same skillet, cook the bulk Italian sausage, breaking it up with a spoon, until it is browned and cooked through. Drain off all the excess grease.

    Comment: This step is absolutely essential. Pre-cooking sausage and bacon and draining them thoroughly is the professional secret to preventing a greasy, soggy pizza.

3. Finalize Oven and Pan Setup

    Arrange a pizza stone or steel on a rack in the upper third of your oven.

    Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) for at least 45 minutes to ensure the baking surface is intensely hot.

4. Shape the Foundation

    Once the dough has risen, gently deflate it and divide it into two equal pieces.

    On a floured surface, take one piece and gently stretch and press it into a 12-inch circle, maintaining a slightly thicker rim for the crust.

5. Layer the Components

    Place your shaped dough onto a pizza peel that is well-dusted with cornmeal or semolina flour to prevent sticking.

    Spread a thin, even layer of your pizza sauce across the surface, leaving a 1-inch border for the crust.

    Create a foundational layer by sprinkling about half of the shredded mozzarella cheese directly onto the sauce.

    Evenly distribute the cooked Italian sausage, crispy bacon, and pepperoni slices over the cheese.

    Sprinkle the remaining half of the mozzarella cheese over the top of the meats.

    Tip: Placing cheese both under and over the toppings helps to lock them in place and ensures every bite is cheesy.

6. Bake to Perfection

    Give the peel a little shimmy to make sure the pizza is loose and ready to slide.

    In one fluid motion, transfer the pizza from the peel onto the hot stone in the oven.

    Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbling with browned spots, and the crust is a deep golden-brown.

7. Rest and Serve

    Using the peel, carefully retrieve the pizza from the oven and place it on a cutting board.

    Let the pizza rest for 4-5 minutes before slicing. This allows the molten cheese and juices from the meat to set slightly, preventing the toppings from sliding off when you cut into it.

    Slice into wedges and serve immediately.
