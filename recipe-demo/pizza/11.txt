For the Neapolitan-style dough (makes 4 pizzas):
    500g "Tipo 00" flour
    325ml cool water
    10g fine sea salt
    1g instant yeast
For the classic filling (per pizza):
    ¼ cup whole milk ricotta cheese
    2 ounces low-moisture mozzarella or smoked provola, cubed
    1 ounce salami or prosciutto cotto (cooked ham), diced
    1 tbsp grated Pecorino or Parmesan cheese
    Freshly ground black pepper
For frying and serving:
    4-6 cups neutral, high-smoke-point oil (like canola, vegetable, or sunflower oil)
    Optional: a simple, warm marinara sauce for dipping or spooning on top

1. Prepare the Dough in Advance

    Following the authentic Neapolitan method, create your dough by mixing the flour, water, salt, and yeast. Knead thoroughly and allow it to undergo a long, cold fermentation in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours.

    About 4-6 hours before you plan to cook, divide the dough into four portions, shape into balls, and let them proof at room temperature until soft and puffy.

2. Mix the Creamy Filling

    In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, cubed mozzarella or provola, diced salami, and grated Pecorino cheese.

    Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Stir gently until just combined.

    Tip: Ensure your ricotta is well-drained. Excess moisture in the filling can turn to steam and compromise the seal during frying.

3. Ready Your Frying Station

    Pour the oil into a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven until it is at least 2-3 inches deep.

    Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a steady temperature of 350-360°F (175-180°C). Use a cooking thermometer for accuracy.

    Comment: Maintaining the correct oil temperature is the most crucial part of this recipe. Too low, and the pizza will be greasy; too high, and the outside will burn before the inside is cooked.

4. Shape and Seal the Pizza

    Place one proofed dough ball on a lightly floured surface. Gently stretch it with your hands into a thin 8 to 10-inch circle.

    Spoon about a quarter of the cheese filling onto one half of the dough circle, leaving a 1-inch border clear around the edge.

    Lightly moisten the border with a fingertip dipped in water. Fold the empty half of the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape.

    Firmly press and pinch the edges together to create an airtight seal. You can go over it a second time to be certain.

5. Fry to Golden Perfection

    Carefully lift the sealed pizza fritta and gently lower it into the hot oil. It should sink for a moment and then float to the surface.

    Fry for about 1.5 to 2 minutes on the first side, until it is dramatically puffed and deep golden-brown.

    Using tongs or a spider skimmer, carefully flip the pizza and fry for another 1.5 to 2 minutes on the other side.

6. Drain and Finish

    Once both sides are golden and crispy, remove the pizza fritta from the oil, allowing any excess to drip off.

    Transfer it to a wire rack to drain. Do not place it on paper towels, as this can steam the bottom and make it less crispy.

7. Serve Immediately

    Pizza fritta is meant to be eaten immediately while it's piping hot and at its crispiest.

    Serve it as is, or with a side of warm marinara for dipping. For a more traditional presentation, you can spoon a line of sauce over the top just before serving.
