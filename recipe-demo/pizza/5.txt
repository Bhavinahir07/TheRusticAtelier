For the buttery cornmeal crust:
    3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
    ½ cup yellow cornmeal
    2 ¼ tsp instant yeast
    2 tsp sugar
    1 ½ tsp salt
    1 ¼ cups lukewarm water
    ½ cup unsalted butter, melted (plus more for the pan)
For the chunky tomato sauce:
    1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained and hand-crushed
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1 tbsp olive oil
    1 tsp dried oregano
    ½ tsp salt
    Pinch of red pepper flakes
For the fillings:
    1 lb low-moisture mozzarella cheese, sliced ¼-inch thick
    ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
    1 lb Italian sausage, cooked and crumbled (optional)
    Other optional fillings: sautéed mushrooms, onions, bell peppers

1. Prepare the Dough

    In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, instant yeast, sugar, and salt.

    Add the lukewarm water and melted butter. Using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms.

    Increase the speed to medium and knead for 5-7 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. It will be soft and oily.

    Comment: The high amount of butter and the addition of cornmeal are essential for the rich flavor and sturdy, biscuit-like texture of a true Chicago crust.

2. Let the Dough Rise

    Form the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel.

    Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it has nearly doubled in volume.

3. Prepare the Pan and Oven

    Generously grease a 9-inch or 10-inch deep-dish pizza pan or a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet with softened butter, making sure to coat the high sides thoroughly.

    Position a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 425°F (220°C).

4. Form the Crust Shell

    Gently punch down the risen dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll it out into a large circle, about 14-15 inches in diameter.

    Carefully transfer the dough into your prepared pan. Press it firmly across the bottom and up the high sides of the pan, creating a thick wall of dough. The dough should extend about 1.5 inches up the sides.

    Tip: Ensure the dough is pressed evenly into the corners of the pan to create a strong structure that won't slump during baking.

5. Assemble in Reverse Order

    Begin the layering process. First, shingle the slices of mozzarella cheese directly onto the bottom of the dough, covering it completely and pressing the cheese against the sides.

    Next, add your layer of cooked Italian sausage or any other toppings you desire.

    Sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese over the toppings.

    Comment: This reverse layering is the most crucial part of a Chicago pizza. It prevents the cheese from burning and turning oily during the long bake.

6. Top with Chunky Sauce

    In a bowl, gently mix the hand-crushed tomatoes with the minced garlic, olive oil, oregano, salt, and red pepper flakes. Do not cook the sauce.

    Pour the chunky tomato sauce evenly over the top of the pizza, spreading it to the edges of the crust. This top layer of sauce protects the fillings and caramelizes slightly in the oven.

7. Bake the Deep-Dish Pie

    Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 25-35 minutes.

    The pizza is done when the crust is a deep golden-brown and the tomato sauce on top is thick and bubbly.

8. Rest and Serve

    Carefully remove the pan from the oven and place it on a wire rack. Let the pizza rest in the pan for a full 10 minutes.

    Tip: This resting period is mandatory. It allows the molten cheese and sauce to set, preventing the pie from falling apart when you slice into it.

    After resting, use a knife to run around the edge of the pizza to loosen it, then carefully lift it from the pan with a spatula. Slice into thick wedges and serve immediately.
