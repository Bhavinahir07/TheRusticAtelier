The Vegetable Base:
    4 medium Zucchinis (approx. 2 lbs / 1kg), grated coarsely
    2-3 Spring Onions (Scallions), finely sliced (white and green parts)
    1 small Red Onion, finely chopped or grated
    1 tbsp Salt (for draining the zucchini)
The Flavor & Binder:
    1 cup (150g) Feta Cheese, crumbled
    ½ cup fresh Dill, finely chopped
    ½ cup fresh Mint, finely chopped
    ¼ cup fresh Parsley, finely chopped
    2 large Eggs, lightly beaten
    1 cup (120g) All-Purpose Flour (or self-raising for fluffier fritters)
    Freshly ground Black Pepper
For Frying:
    Olive Oil or Vegetable Oil (enough for shallow frying, about ½ inch deep)
For Serving:
    Tzatziki (Greek yogurt, cucumber, garlic dip)
    Lemon wedges

1. Grate and Drain (The Most Crucial Step)
    Wash the zucchinis and trim the ends. Grate them using the coarse side of a box grater.
    Place the grated zucchini in a colander over a bowl. Sprinkle generously with the 1 tbsp of salt. Toss to coat.
    Rest: Let it sit for at least 20-30 minutes. The salt will draw out the excess moisture.
    Squeeze: Take handfuls of the zucchini and squeeze them hard with your hands to wring out as much liquid as possible. (Alternatively, wrap in a clean kitchen towel and twist). Discard the liquid. The zucchini should be dry and clumped together.
2. Mix the Batter
    In a large bowl, place the squeezed "dry" zucchini.
    Add the chopped spring onions, red onion, dill, mint, and parsley.
    Add the crumbled Feta cheese and the beaten eggs. Season with plenty of black pepper. (Be careful adding extra salt, as the feta and the zucchini are already salty).
    Mix well with a spoon or your hands.
3. Add the Flour
    Gradually add the flour, mixing continuously.
    Technique: You are looking for a consistency that is moist but holds its shape. It shouldn't be runny batter, nor a stiff dough. If it's too wet, add a little more flour; if too dry, add a tiny splash of milk or water.
4. Heat the Oil
    Pour oil into a large, deep frying pan or skillet until it is about ½ inch (1-1.5 cm) deep.
    Heat over medium-high heat. To test if it's ready, drop a tiny bit of batter in. If it sizzles immediately and floats, it's ready. (If it smokes, it's too hot).
5. Fry the Fritters
    Using a tablespoon or an ice cream scoop, drop mounds of the batter into the hot oil.
    Gently flatten them slightly with the back of a spoon to create a patty shape (don't make them too thick, or the center won't cook).
    Do not overcrowd the pan. Fry in batches of 4-5.
    Cook for about 2-3 minutes on the first side until deep golden brown. Flip carefully and cook for another 2-3 minutes on the other side.
6. Drain and Serve
    Remove the fritters with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.
    Serve immediately while they are hot and crispy. Squeeze a little lemon juice over them and dip generously in cool Tzatziki.
