The Meat:
    1.5 lbs (700g) Boneless Ribeye or Top Sirloin
    Tip: Freeze the meat for 30 minutes before slicing to make it easier to get paper-thin slices.
The Marinade:
    ½ cup (120ml) Soy Sauce
    3 tbsp Brown Sugar
    2 tbsp Mirin (Rice Wine)
    ½ Asian Pear (Korean/Nashi Pear), grated (essential for tenderizing)
    1 small Onion, grated
    4 cloves Garlic, minced
    1 tsp Fresh Ginger, grated
    2 tbsp Toasted Sesame Oil
    ½ tsp Black Pepper
The Mix-ins:
    2 stalks Scallions (Green Onions), chopped
    1 small Carrot, julienned (optional)
    1 tbsp Toasted Sesame Seeds
For Serving (The Ssam Wrap):
    Red Leaf Lettuce or Perilla Leaves
    Steamed Rice
    Ssamjang (Korean spicy dipping paste)
    Kimchi

1. Prepare the Beef
    If you chilled your beef slightly, take it out. Slice the beef against the grain into paper-thin slices (about 1/8 inch thick).
    Place the sliced beef in a large mixing bowl.
    Note: If you can find pre-sliced "Bulgogi meat" at an Asian grocery store, you can skip this step.
2. Make the Marinade
    In a medium bowl or blender, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, mirin, grated pear, grated onion, minced garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and black pepper.
    Stir (or blend) until the sugar is completely dissolved.
    Why Pear? The enzymes in the pear will break down the tough fibers of the beef, making it incredibly tender. Do not skip this!
3. Marinate the Meat
    Pour the marinade over the sliced beef.
    Add the chopped scallions and sesame seeds (and carrots if using).
    Technique: Put on a disposable glove and massage the meat with your hand. Rub the marinade into every slice, separating them so they don't clump together.
    Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, ideally 2-3 hours, or up to overnight.
4. Heat the Grill (or Pan)
    Outdoor Grill: Preheat a grill pan or mesh grill topper over high heat. (You need a topper so the small slices don't fall through).
    Indoor Stovetop: Heat a large cast-iron skillet or heavy pan over high heat. Add 1 tbsp of cooking oil.
5. Cook the Bulgogi
    When the pan is smoking hot, add the beef in a single layer. Do not overcrowd the pan, or the beef will boil in its juices instead of searing. Cook in batches if necessary.
    Let it sear undisturbed for 1-2 minutes until caramelized and brown/black bits appear on the edges.
    Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fully cooked through.
    Tip: You want that "char" flavor. The sugar in the marinade helps this happen quickly.
6. Serve (The Ssam Method)
    Transfer the hot beef to a serving platter. Garnish with extra scallions and sesame seeds.
    How to Eat: Take a lettuce leaf. Place a small spoonful of rice in the center. Add a piece of grilled beef. Top with a dab of Ssamjang and a piece of Kimchi. Wrap it into a tight ball and eat it in one bite!
