The Base:
    4 cups Steamed Korean Short-Grain Rice (Sushi rice works)
The Meat (Bulgogi Style):
    ½ lb (225g) Beef (Ribeye or Sirloin), thinly sliced or ground
    Marinade: 1 tbsp Soy Sauce, 1 tsp Sugar, 1 tsp Sesame Oil, 1 clove Garlic (minced)
The Vegetables (Namul):
    Spinach: 1 bunch, blanched and squeezed
    Bean Sprouts: 2 cups, blanched
    Carrots: 1 medium, julienned (cut into matchsticks)
    Shiitake Mushrooms: 4-5, sliced
    Zucchini: 1 small, julienned
    Seasoning for Veg: Salt, Minced Garlic, Sesame Oil, Toasted Sesame Seeds
The Sauce (Yak-Gochujang):
    2 tbsp Gochujang (Korean Red Chili Paste)
    1 tbsp Sesame Oil
    1 tbsp Sugar (or honey)
    1-2 tsp Water (to thin slightly)
    1 tsp Vinegar (optional, for tang)
    Toppings:
    4 Eggs
    Dried Seaweed strips (Gim), optional
    Toasted Sesame Seeds

1. Prepare the Meat
    In a small bowl, mix the beef with the soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and minced garlic.
    Let it marinate while you prepare the vegetables.
2. Prepare the Vegetables (The Labor of Love)
    The Blanching: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Blanch the spinach for 30 seconds. Remove, rinse in cold water, and squeeze thoroughly to remove excess water. Season with a pinch of salt, minced garlic, and sesame oil. Repeat this exact process for the Bean Sprouts.
    The Sautéing: Heat a skillet with a little oil. Sauté the carrots for 1-2 minutes until slightly softened but still crunchy. Remove. Sauté the zucchini. Remove. Sauté the mushrooms. Remove.
    Comment: Cook them separately! If you cook them together, the colors will bleed and the flavors will muddy. You want distinct piles of color.
3. Cook the Meat
    In the same skillet over high heat, add the marinated beef.
    Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until fully cooked and slightly caramelized. Set aside.
4. Fry the Eggs
    Wipe the skillet clean. Add a little oil.
    Crack the eggs and fry them sunny-side up. The whites should be set, but the yolk must be runny. The yolk acts as a rich sauce when mixed.
5. Make the Sauce
    In a small bowl, mix the Gochujang, sesame oil, sugar, water, and vinegar. Stir until smooth and glossy.
6. Assembly (The Art)
    Place a serving of hot steamed rice in the bottom of a large bowl.
    Arrange the vegetables and meat in neat, contrasting piles around the rice (e.g., Green spinach next to Orange carrots next to Brown beef).
    Place the sunny-side-up egg directly in the center.
    Sprinkle with sesame seeds and seaweed strips.
7. Serve and Mix (Bibim)
    Serve with the sauce on the side (or a dollop on top).
    How to Eat: Add the desired amount of sauce. Use a spoon to break the egg yolk and mix everything vigorously until the rice turns red and every grain is coated with egg, sauce, and vegetable bits. Do not eat it delicately; it is meant to be a beautiful mess!
