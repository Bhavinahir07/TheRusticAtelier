The Base:
    6 oz (170g) Dangmyeon (Korean Sweet Potato Starch Noodles)
    1 tbsp Sesame Oil (for coating noodles)
The Protein:
    4 oz (115g) Beef (Ribeye or Sirloin), cut into thin strips
    Beef Marinade: 1 tsp Soy Sauce, 1 tsp Sugar, 1 tsp Sesame Oil, 1 clove Garlic (minced)
The Vegetables:
    1 bunch Spinach, washed
    1 small Carrot, julienned (matchsticks)
    ½ Onion, sliced thinly
    4-5 dried Shiitake Mushrooms (soaked until soft, then sliced) or Wood Ear Mushrooms
    1 Red Bell Pepper, sliced thinly (optional, for color)
The Japchae Sauce:
    3 tbsp Soy Sauce
    2 tbsp Sugar (or Brown Sugar)
    1 tbsp Sesame Oil (essential flavor)
    1 tsp Minced Garlic
    1 tbsp Roasted Sesame Seeds
    Black Pepper

1. Marinate the Beef
    In a small bowl, mix the beef strips with the marinade ingredients. Set aside while you prep the vegetables.
2. Blanch the Spinach
    Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the spinach and blanch for only 30-45 seconds.
    Immediately drain and shock in ice water to stop cooking. Squeeze out all excess water thoroughly.
    Cut the spinach ball in half. Season lightly with a pinch of salt and a drop of sesame oil.
3. Cook the Noodles (Dangmyeon)
    In the same boiling water, add the dried glass noodles.
    Boil for 6-8 minutes (or according to package) until soft and chewy.
    Drain and rinse well under cold water.
    Tip: Use kitchen shears to cut the noodles a few times (they are very long). Toss them with 1 tbsp of sesame oil to prevent sticking.
4. Pan-Fry Vegetables (Separate Cooking)
    Heat a skillet over medium heat with a little oil.
    Order of Operations: Cook the lighter/cleaner vegetables first so flavors/colors don't bleed.
    Onions: Sauté with a pinch of salt until translucent. Remove to a large mixing bowl.
    Carrots: Sauté with a pinch of salt until slightly softened. Remove to the bowl.
    Peppers: Sauté briefly. Remove to the bowl.
    Mushrooms: Sauté until tender. Remove to the bowl.
    Beef: Turn heat to high. Add the marinated beef. Stir-fry until browned and fully cooked. Remove to the bowl.
5. Simmer the Sauce (Optional but Professional)
    In the empty pan, pour in the Japchae Sauce ingredients (soy sauce, sugar, garlic, sesame oil).
    Bring to a simmer for 1 minute to dissolve the sugar.
    Add the cooked noodles to the pan and toss for 1-2 minutes. This allows the noodles to absorb the flavor and warm up.
6. Mix and Serve
    Transfer the hot, sauced noodles into the large mixing bowl with all the cooked vegetables and beef.
    Add the seasoned spinach and sesame seeds.
    Technique: Put on a plastic food prep glove (or use tongs). Toss everything together by hand to distribute the ingredients evenly.
    Taste and adjust sweetness or saltiness.
    Serve warm or at room temperature. (Japchae reheats well in a microwave or frying pan).
