The Essentials:
    1 lb (450g) Garaetteok (Fresh cylinder rice cakes)
    2 sheets Eomuk (Korean fish cakes), cut into triangles or strips
    2 stalks Scallions, cut into 2-inch lengths
    2 Hard-boiled eggs (optional, but classic)
The Broth:
    3 cups (700ml) Water
    5-6 large dried Anchovies (gutted)
    1 piece dried Kelp (Dashima), 3x3 inches
The Sauce (Yangnyeom):
    3 tbsp Gochujang (Korean Red Chili Paste)
    1 tbsp Gochugaru (Korean Fine Chili Flakes) - adjust for heat
    1 tbsp Soy Sauce
    2 tbsp Sugar (or 1 tbsp Sugar + 1 tbsp Corn Syrup for gloss)
    1 tbsp Minced Garlic

1. Prep the Rice Cakes
    If using chilled rice cakes, soak them in lukewarm water for 10-15 minutes to soften. If fresh, just rinse them quickly.
    Tip: If the cakes are hard, they will crack during cooking. Soaking is essential for frozen ones.
2. Make the Anchovy Broth (The Umami Base)
    In a large pan or wok (a deep skillet works best), add the water, dried anchovies, and dried kelp.
    Bring to a boil uncovered. Boil for 10 minutes.
    Remove the anchovies and kelp. You now have a flavorful savory stock.
3. Make the Sauce Base
    To the boiling broth, add the Gochujang, Gochugaru, soy sauce, sugar, and minced garlic.
    Stir well until the Gochujang dissolves completely. The liquid should be a vibrant red.
4. Simmer the Cakes
    Add the rice cakes to the pan.
    Simmer over medium-high heat for about 5-7 minutes. Stir often so the cakes don't stick to the bottom.
    As the cakes cook, they will release starch, helping to thicken the broth.
5. Add Fish Cakes and Veg
    Add the fish cakes and hard-boiled eggs.
    Continue to simmer for another 5-7 minutes.
    Crucial Step: Watch the consistency. You want the sauce to reduce from a watery soup to a thick, shiny glaze that clings to the rice cakes. If it's too runny, cook longer. If it's too thick, add a splash of water.
6. Finish and Serve
    Add the scallions and cook for 1 minute more just to wilt them.
    Turn off the heat. For extra shine, you can drizzle a tiny bit of sesame oil (optional).
    Serve immediately while piping hot and chewy.
