The Salad Base:
    1 can (15oz / 425g) Chickpeas (Garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
    1 stalk Celery, finely diced
    2 tbsp Red Onion, finely diced
    2 tbsp Dill Pickles or Cornichons, finely diced
    1 tbsp Fresh Dill, chopped (or 1 tsp dried)
    1 tbsp Sunflower seeds or Pumpkin seeds (optional, for extra crunch)
The Creamy Dressing:
    3 tbsp Mayonnaise (or Vegan Mayo / Greek Yogurt)
    1 tsp Dijon Mustard
    1 tsp Lemon Juice (fresh is best)
    ½ tsp Maple Syrup or Honey (balances the acidity)
    ½ tsp Garlic Powder
    Salt and Black Pepper, to taste
For Assembly:
    4 slices Whole Grain or Sourdough Bread, toasted
    Lettuce or Baby Spinach
    Sliced Tomato
    Avocado slices (optional)

1. Prep the Chickpeas
    Drain the chickpeas into a colander and rinse thoroughly with cold water. Shake off excess water.
    Tip: If you have time, roll the chickpeas gently between two clean kitchen towels to dry them and remove some of the loose skins. This makes for a creamier salad, but it's not strictly necessary.
2. The "Rough Smash"
    Place the chickpeas in a medium mixing bowl.
    Using a potato masher or a sturdy fork, smash the beans.
    Technique: Stop when the mixture looks "flaky." You want about 50% mashed paste and 50% chunky bits. Do not puree it into a smooth paste.
3. Add Crunch and Flavor
    Add the diced celery, red onion, pickles, fresh dill, and sunflower seeds to the bowl.
    Stir to combine with the mashed chickpeas.
4. Dress the Salad
    In a small bowl (or directly into the main bowl to save dishes), mix the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, maple syrup, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
    Pour the dressing over the chickpea mixture.
    Stir well until everything is evenly coated and creamy.
    Taste Test: This is crucial. Chickpeas are starchy and need salt. Add more salt, lemon, or mustard until the flavor "pops."
5. Assemble the Sandwich
    Toast your bread slices until golden and sturdy (this helps hold the weight of the filling).
    Place a layer of lettuce on the bottom slice (this acts as a barrier to prevent the bread from getting soggy).
    Scoop a generous amount of the chickpea salad onto the lettuce.
    Top with sliced tomatoes and avocado.
    Close the sandwich with the top slice of bread. Press down gently.
6. Serve
    Slice the sandwich in half (diagonal cuts taste better!).
    Serve immediately, or store the salad mixture in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days (it gets better as it sits).
