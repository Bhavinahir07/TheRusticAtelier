The Broth Base:
    ½ lb (225g) Beef Brisket
    6 cups Water
    ½ Onion
    5 cloves Garlic
    3 slices Ginger
    The "Mix": 1 cup Dongchimi Brine (Radish Water Kimchi liquid) - found in Korean markets (Substitute: ¼ cup Rice Vinegar + 2 tbsp Sugar + ½ tsp Salt)
The Noodles:
    2 bundles Dried Naengmyeon Noodles (Buckwheat/Starch blend)
The Toppings:
    Pickled Radish: thinly sliced Korean radish soaked in vinegar/sugar/salt for 20 mins
    Cucumber: Julienned
    Korean Pear: Sliced into half-moons (essential for fresh sweetness)
    1 Hard-boiled Egg, halved
    The cooked Beef Brisket, sliced thin
Condiments (Served on the side):
    Gyeoja (Korean yellow mustard paste)
    White Vinegar

1. Make the Beef Stock
    Soak the brisket in cold water for 30 minutes to draw out blood.
    In a pot, add the 6 cups of water, beef, onion, garlic, and ginger. Bring to a boil.
    Skim off the scum. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour until the beef is tender.
    Strain the broth through a cheesecloth or fine sieve to get a crystal clear liquid. Keep the beef.
2. Season and Freeze the Broth (The Slush Factor)
    Combine the clear beef stock with the Dongchimi brine (or vinegar substitute).
    Taste it. It should be savory, slightly sour, and a little sweet. Adjust with more vinegar or sugar to taste.
    Technique: Pour the broth into a container and place it in the freezer. Let it sit for 3-4 hours until it becomes a slushy ice mixture. Shake it occasionally.
3. Prep the Toppings
    Slice the cooled cooked beef brisket into thin, bite-sized pieces.
    Pickle the radish slices (vinegar, sugar, salt) and let sit for 20 minutes.
    Slice the pear and cucumber.
    Boil the egg.
4. Cook the Noodles
    Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil.
    Add the Naengmyeon noodles.
    Timing: These cook incredibly fast (usually 2-3 minutes). Watch them closely; if overcooked, they turn mushy.
    Drain and scrub vigorously under cold running water. You must wash off all the starch to get the signature chewy, elastic texture.
5. Assemble
    Place a mound of noodles in the center of a stainless steel bowl (the metal keeps it cold).
    Pour the slushy icy broth over the noodles.
    Artfully stack the toppings on the noodles: first the beef, then radish, cucumber, pear, and finally the egg on top.
6. Serve
    Serve immediately with the mustard paste and vinegar on the side.
    How to Eat: Most people add a squirt of vinegar and a dab of mustard into the bowl, mix well, and slurp loudly! Note: Use kitchen scissors to cut the long noodles once or twice if they are too chewy to manage.
