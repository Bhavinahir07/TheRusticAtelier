The Base (Chili Oil Paste):
    2 tbsp Gochugaru (Korean Chili Flakes)
    1 tbsp Vegetable Oil
    1 tbsp Sesame Oil
    ½ cup (approx. 100g) Pork Belly or Shoulder, minced or cut very small
    2 stalks Scallions (white parts), chopped
    1 tbsp Minced Garlic
The Stew:
    1 tube (approx. 350g) Sundubu (Extra Soft/Silken Tofu)
    1 cup (240ml) Anchovy Kelp Stock (or water)
    ½ cup (approx. 100g) Manila Clams, cleaned and soaked
    ¼ cup Kimchi, chopped (optional, for acidity)
    1 tbsp Soy Sauce (Soup Soy Sauce is best)
    ½ tsp Salt (adjust to taste)
    ½ tsp Sugar (to balance the spice)
The Finish:
    1 Egg
    Scallions (green parts), chopped
    Black Pepper

1. Make the Flavor Base (Gochu-gireum)
    Heat a small earthenware pot (Ttukbaegi) or a small pot over medium heat.
    Add the vegetable oil and sesame oil.
    Add the minced pork, white scallions, and garlic. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the pork is cooked and the fat has rendered.
    Crucial Step: Add the Gochugaru (chili flakes). Stir-fry constantly for 1 minute. Be careful not to burn it.
    Result: The oil should turn a vibrant, deep red. This "chili oil" is the flavor foundation.
2. Build the Broth
    Pour in the stock (or water) and the chopped Kimchi (if using).
    Bring to a vigorous boil.
    Add the soy sauce, salt, and sugar. Taste the broth; it should be quite salty and spicy (the tofu will dilute it later).
3. Add the Tofu and Seafood
    Cut the tube of soft tofu in half. Squeeze the large chunks of silken tofu directly into the boiling stew.
    Technique: Use a spoon to gently break the tofu into large chunks. Do not whisk it, or it will turn into mush. You want distinct, custard-like pieces.
    Add the clams. Continue to boil for 3-4 minutes until the clams open up.
4. The Egg Finish
    Once the clams are open and the stew is bubbling violently, crack the raw egg directly into the center of the pot.
    Turn off the heat immediately.
5. Serve
    Top with the green scallions and a crack of black pepper.
    Serve while the stew is still bubbling.
    How to Eat: Use your spoon to gently bury the egg under the hot tofu to let it poach to your desired doneness, then mix it into the broth for creaminess. Eat with rice.
