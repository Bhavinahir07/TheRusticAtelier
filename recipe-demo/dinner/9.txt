For the Handmade Noodles:
    2 ½ cups (350g) All-Purpose Flour (plus more for dusting)
    ½ tsp Salt
    1 tbsp Vegetable Oil (makes the dough smoother)
    ¾ cup (180ml) Water (adjust slightly as needed)
For the Broth (Yuksu):
    8 cups (2 liters) Water
    10-15 large Dried Anchovies (gutted)
    1 piece Dried Kelp (Dashima), 4x4 inches
    ½ Onion
    1 lb (450g) Manila Clams or Littleneck Clams (optional, for Bajirak Kalguksu)
For the Soup:
    1 medium Potato, peeled and sliced into half-moons
    1 small Zucchini (Aehobak), julienned into matchsticks
    2 stalks Scallions, chopped
    1 tbsp Minced Garlic
    1-2 tbsp Soup Soy Sauce (Guk-ganjang) or Fish Sauce
    Salt and Pepper to taste
    Crumbled Seaweed (Gim) for garnish

1. Make the Dough
    In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, oil, and water.
    Mix by hand until a rough dough forms.
    Knead: Knead the dough firmly for 5-7 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. This develops the gluten needed for the "chew."
    Rest: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 20-30 minutes. Resting relaxes the dough so it can be rolled out thinly without shrinking back.
2. Make the Broth
    While the dough rests, place the water, dried anchovies, dried kelp, and onion in a large pot.
    Bring to a boil uncovered. Boil for 10 minutes.
    Remove the kelp (it gets slimy if boiled too long). Boil the anchovies for another 10 minutes.
    Strain the broth and discard the solids. Return the clear golden broth to the pot.
3. Roll and Cut the Noodles (The "Kal" Step)
    Dust a large cutting board generously with flour.
    Roll the dough out into a large, thin sheet (about 2mm thick).
    Fold: Dust the surface of the sheet with flour (crucial to prevent sticking). Fold the sheet over itself 3 or 4 times into a flat log.
    Cut: Using a sharp knife, slice through the folded dough to create noodles about 1/8 inch wide.
    Shake: Toss the noodles with your hands to unravel them and coat them in flour. Do not shake off all the flour; some is needed to thicken the soup.
4. Start the Soup
    Bring the broth back to a boil.
    Add the sliced potatoes and the clams (if using). Cook for 3-4 minutes until the potatoes are half-cooked.
5. Cook the Noodles
    Add the handmade noodles to the boiling broth. Stir gently to prevent them from sticking together.
    Add the minced garlic and Soup Soy Sauce.
    Boil for about 4-5 minutes. The broth will turn slightly milky/thick from the flour.
6. Finish and Serve
    Add the julienned zucchini and scallions. Cook for 1-2 minutes more until the zucchini is tender but bright green.
    Taste the broth. Adjust seasoning with salt (anchovies are salty, so taste first).
    Ladle into large bowls. Top with crumbled seaweed and freshly ground black pepper. Serve with kimchi.
