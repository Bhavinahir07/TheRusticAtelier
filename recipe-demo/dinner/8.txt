The Meat:
    1.5 lbs (700g) Fresh Pork Belly (Samgyeopsal), cut into thick strips (about ½ inch thick). Do not use cured bacon.
    Coarse Sea Salt & Black Pepper (for sprinkling)
The "Grill Mates":
    1 cup Aged Kimchi (sour kimchi is best for grilling)
    10-15 cloves Garlic, whole or sliced thickly
    1 Onion, sliced into thick rings
    2-3 King Oyster Mushrooms, sliced lengthwise (optional)
The Pajeori (Spicy Scallion Salad) - Essential:
    2 bunches Scallions (Green Onions), shredded into thin curls
    Dressing: 1 tbsp Soy Sauce, 1 tbsp Vinegar, 1 tsp Sugar, 1 tbsp Gochugaru (Chili Flakes), 1 tbsp Sesame Oil, 1 tsp Sesame Seeds.
The Dips & Wraps:
    Ssamjang: Store-bought green tub, or mix 2 tbsp Soybean Paste (Doenjang) + 1 tbsp Chili Paste (Gochujang) + 1 tsp Garlic + 1 tsp Honey/Sugar + 1 tsp Sesame Oil.
    Gireumjang (Oil Dip): Small dish of Sea Salt + Black Pepper + Sesame Oil.
    Wraps: Red Leaf Lettuce, Perilla Leaves (Kkaennip), Green Chilies.

1. Prepare the Scallion Salad (Pajeori)
    Soak the shredded scallions in ice water for 10 minutes to remove the harsh onion bite and make them curl. Drain and dry thoroughly.
    Just before eating, toss the scallions with the dressing ingredients. (Do not dress too early, or they will get soggy).
2. Set the Table
    Korean BBQ is cooked at the table. Set up a portable butane burner with a grill pan (preferably one with a drain for fat) or a cast-iron skillet.
    Arrange the lettuce, perilla leaves, dips (Ssamjang and Gireumjang), and raw garlic/chilies on the table.
3. Heat the Pan
    Turn the heat to medium-high. The pan needs to be hot.
    Tip: If using a slanted grill pan, ensure the drain hole is at the bottom.
4. Grill the Meat
    Place the strips of pork belly on the pan. You should hear a loud sizzle.
    Sprinkle the meat lightly with coarse salt and pepper.
    Technique: Place the whole garlic cloves, onion slices, and the Kimchi on the lower side of the pan (where the fat drains). The rendering pork fat will fry the kimchi and garlic, making them incredibly delicious.
5. The "Golden" Flip
    Let the pork cook undisturbed until the bottom is a deep, crispy golden brown.
    Flip the meat. Cook the other side until golden.
    Using kitchen shears and tongs, cut the pork into bite-sized pieces while it is still on the grill.
    Cook the cut pieces for another 1-2 minutes, turning them so all four sides get crispy.
6. Serve (The Ssam Method)
    Take a piece of pork off the grill. Dip it lightly in the Gireumjang (salt/oil).
    Place a lettuce leaf and a perilla leaf in your hand.
    Add the pork. Top with a dab of Ssamjang, a piece of grilled garlic, a piece of grilled kimchi, and a pinch of scallion salad.
    Wrap it into a ball and eat it in one bite. The combination of hot, fatty pork with cold, crisp vegetables and tangy salad is the perfect bite.
