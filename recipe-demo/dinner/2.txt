For the Saffron Rice:
    2 cups (400g) Arborio or Carnaroli Rice
    5 cups (1.2 liters) Vegetable Stock or Water
    1 tsp Saffron threads (steeped in a little hot water)
    3 tbsp Butter
    ½ cup Grated Parmesan Cheese
    1 tsp Salt
For the Ragù Filling:
    ½ lb (225g) Ground Beef (or Beef/Pork mix)
    ½ cup Onion, finely chopped
    ½ cup Peas (frozen is fine)
    2 tbsp Tomato Paste
    ½ cup Red Wine
    ½ cup Water
    Salt and Pepper
    4 oz (115g) Low-moisture Mozzarella or Caciocavallo, cut into small cubes
For the Breading & Frying:
    The Batter (Lega): 1 cup All-Purpose Flour whisked with 1 cup Water (until pancake batter consistency)
    2 cups Dry Breadcrumbs
    Vegetable Oil (for deep frying)

1. Cook the Rice (The Foundation)
    In a large pot, bring the stock (or water), saffron (with its soaking liquid), butter, and salt to a boil.
    Add the rice. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the rice absorbs all the liquid and is tender (about 15-18 minutes).
    Comment: This is not a loose risotto. It should be thick and sticky.
    Stir in the Parmesan cheese.
    Spread the rice out onto a large baking sheet in a thin layer. Cover with plastic wrap (touching the surface) and let it cool completely (at least 2 hours or overnight in the fridge).
2. Make the Thick Ragù
    While rice cools, sauté the onion in a pan with oil. Add the ground meat and brown well.
    Add the tomato paste and cook for a minute. Deglaze with red wine.
    Add the water and peas. Simmer gently until the sauce is very thick and tight.
    Tip: The sauce cannot be watery, or the arancini will leak. It should be a paste, not a soup. Let it cool completely.
3. Shape the Arancini
    Set up your station: A bowl of water (to wet hands), the cooled rice, the cooled ragù, and the cheese cubes.
    Wet your hand. Take a handful of rice (about tennis ball size). Flatten it into your cupped palm to create a hollow bowl shape.
    Place a spoonful of ragù and a cube of cheese in the center.
    Take a smaller amount of rice and place it on top to close the "lid."
    Gently mold the rice around the filling to seal it completely.
    The Shape: For Ragù, the traditional shape is often conical (like a pear or volcano), representing Mount Etna. (Butter/Ham arancini are usually round).
4. The Double Breading (Lega Method)
    Station: One bowl with the flour/water batter, one bowl with breadcrumbs.
    Dip the shaped rice ball into the wet batter, ensuring it is fully coated. Shake off excess.
    Roll it immediately in the breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.
    Repeat with all arancini. Let them rest for 10 minutes while oil heats.
5. Deep Fry
    Heat at least 3 inches of oil in a deep pot to 350°F (175°C).
    Fry the arancini in batches (don't overcrowd) for about 4-6 minutes.
    They are done when they are a deep, dark golden orange color (hence the name Arancini - little oranges).
6. Serve
    Drain on wire racks or paper towels.
    Let them cool for 5 minutes before eating (the cheese inside is molten lava). Eat with your hands!
