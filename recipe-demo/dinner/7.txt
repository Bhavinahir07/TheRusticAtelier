The Fillings:
    1 bunch (approx. 8-10 stalks) Scallions (Green Onions), cut into 2-inch lengths
    1 cup (150g) Seafood Mix (Squid strips, Shrimp, Clams/Mussels)
    1 Red Chili and 1 Green Chili, sliced diagonally (optional, for heat and color)
    ½ onion, thinly sliced
The Batter:
    ¾ cup (100g) All-Purpose Flour
    ¼ cup (30g) Cornstarch (or Rice Flour) - essential for crispiness
    ¾ cup to 1 cup (180-240ml) Ice Cold Water
    1 large Egg, beaten
    ½ tsp Salt
    ½ tsp Garlic Powder (or 1 clove minced garlic)
    For Frying:
    3-4 tbsp Vegetable Oil (generous amount)
The Dipping Sauce (Choganjang):
    2 tbsp Soy Sauce
    1 tbsp Rice Vinegar (or Apple Cider Vinegar)
    1 tsp Sugar
    1 tsp Toasted Sesame Seeds
    ½ tsp Gochugaru (Korean Chili Flakes)

1. Prep the Seafood (Crucial for Crispiness)
    If using chilled seafood mix, thaw it completely.
    Rinse the seafood and pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels.
    Why? Any excess water released by the seafood during cooking will steam the pancake, making it soggy instead of crispy.
2. Make the Batter
    In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch (or rice flour), salt, and garlic powder.
    Pour in the ice-cold water. Whisk gently until just combined.
    Tip: Do not overmix. A few lumps are fine. Overmixing develops gluten and makes the pancake tough. The batter should be slightly thinner than American pancake batter.
3. Mix (The Home-Style Method)
    Add the cut scallions, onion slices, and dried seafood directly into the batter.
    Mix gently to coat everything. The ratio should look like a salad coated in dressing, not vegetables swimming in a pool of liquid. There should be more solid ingredients than batter.
4. The Frying
    Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add a generous amount of oil (about 2 tbsp for the first pancake). Swirl to coat the bottom.
    Pour half of the batter mixture into the pan. Spread it out evenly with a spatula to form a thin circle.
    Place the sliced red and green chilies on top for decoration.
    Drizzle the Egg: Pour half of the beaten egg over the top of the pancake. This gives it a beautiful golden color and rich flavor.
5. The Cook and Flip
    Cook for 3-4 minutes. Watch the edges; they should become golden brown and crispy. Shake the pan occasionally to ensure it doesn't stick.
    The Flip: Once the bottom is deeply browned and the top looks slightly set, flip the pancake confidently. (If you are nervous, slide it onto a plate and flip it back into the pan).
    Add a little more oil around the edges if the pan looks dry. Press the pancake down with your spatula to ensure the seafood cooks through and gets crispy. Cook for another 3-4 minutes.
6. Serve
    Slide the pancake onto a cutting board or large plate.
    Mix the dipping sauce ingredients together in a small bowl.
    Cut the pancake into squares or pizza wedges (or tear it with chopsticks for the true traditional experience).
    Serve immediately while sizzling hot.
