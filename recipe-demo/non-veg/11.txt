For the Shashlik:
    3 lbs boneless pork shoulder or lamb shoulder, cut into 1.5-inch cubes
    3 large yellow onions
    1 tbsp coarse salt
    1 tbsp coarsely ground black pepper
    1 tsp ground coriander (optional, but common)
For the Marinade:
    ½ cup white vinegar
    ½ cup water
    ¼ cup vegetable or olive oil
For Serving:
    Lavash (Armenian flatbread) or pita
    Sliced raw onion (often marinated in vinegar and sumac)
    Fresh herbs (dill, parsley, cilantro)
    Pomegranate seeds (optional)
    Tkemali (Georgian plum sauce) or a simple tomato sauce

1. Prepare the Meat and Onions
    Place the cubed pork or lamb in a large, non-reactive bowl (glass or stainless steel).
    Thinly slice two of the onions into half-moons and add them to the bowl with the meat.
    Add the salt, black pepper, and ground coriander (if using).
    Comment: This is the most important step. Using your hands, vigorously massage the onions, salt, and spices into the meat for 3-5 minutes. The goal is to bruise the onions and make them release their juices, which begins the tenderizing process.
2. Mix and Marinate the Meat
    In a separate small bowl, whisk together the white vinegar, water, and oil.
    Pour the liquid marinade over the meat and onion mixture. Mix thoroughly with your hands one more time to ensure every piece of meat is coated.
    Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 6 hours. For the best, most tender results, marinate for 24 hours.
3. Prepare the Grill
    When ready to cook, prepare a charcoal grill. You are aiming for a medium-hot bed of glowing, ashed-over coals.
    Tip: Shashlik is traditionally cooked over hardwood charcoal (like birch) for the best smoky flavor. A gas grill can be used, but the charcoal method is more authentic.
4. Skewer the Meat
    Remove the meat from the marinade, letting the excess liquid drip off. Discard the used marinade and the mass of onions (they will burn on the grill).
    Take the third, fresh onion and cut it into thick 1.5-inch chunks.
    Thread the marinated meat onto long, flat metal skewers.
    Comment: Flat metal skewers (shampury) are traditional and highly recommended. They prevent the meat from spinning when you try to turn them, ensuring an even cook.
    You can alternate the meat with the chunks of fresh onion, which will char and sweeten on the grill.
5. Grill the Shashlik
    Place the skewers over the hot coals. Grill for approximately 10-15 minutes, turning the skewers every 3-4 minutes to cook all sides.
    The meat should be cooked through with a beautiful, smoky char on the outside.
    Tip: You can keep a small bowl of the reserved marinade (before it touched the raw meat) or a mix of lemon juice and water to baste the meat as it cooks, but this is optional.
6. Rest and Serve
    Once cooked, remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest on a platter, loosely tented with foil, for 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a tender bite.
    To serve, you can either present the skewers whole or slide the meat off the skewers onto a large piece of lavash (which will soak up the juices).
    Serve immediately, traditionally garnished with fresh herbs and thinly sliced pickled onions.
