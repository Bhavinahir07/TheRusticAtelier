For the Haggis:
    1 sheep's stomach (bung), or a large ox bung, thoroughly cleaned
    1 set of lamb's pluck (heart, liver, and lungs)
    ¾ lb (approx. 340g) beef suet, finely chopped or grated
    2 large onions, finely chopped
    1 ½ cups (approx. 250g) pinhead oatmeal
    1 tbsp salt
    2 tsp freshly ground black pepper (coarse)
    1 tsp dried coriander, ground
    1 tsp nutmeg, freshly grated
    ½ tsp mace
    Approx. 2 cups reserved stock (from boiling the pluck)
For Serving:
    Neeps (mashed rutabaga/turnip)
    Tatties (mashed potatoes)
    Whisky sauce (optional)

1. Prepare the Casing
    Wash the sheep's stomach thoroughly in cold water. If it has not been pre-cleaned, this is a long process.
    Once clean, submerge it in a large bowl of cold, salted water and let it soak for at least 2 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator. Before use, turn it inside-out so the smooth side is on the inside.
2. Pre-cook the Pluck
    Place the entire lamb's pluck (heart, liver, and lungs) in a very large pot of cold water.
    Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Skim any foam that rises to the surface.
    Simmer gently for 1 to 1.5 hours, until the heart is tender and the liver is just cooked through (it can get bitter if overcooked).
    Remove the pluck from the pot and set it on a tray to cool. Crucially, reserve the cooking liquid (stock).
3. Prepare the Oatmeal and Aromatics
    While the pluck is cooling, spread the pinhead oatmeal on a dry baking sheet.
    Toast the oatmeal in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, or in a dry skillet over medium heat, until it is fragrant and a light golden-brown.
    Comment: Toasting the oatmeal is a vital step. It removes any raw taste and gives the haggis its signature nutty, hearty flavor.
4. Mince the Filling
    Once the pluck is cool enough to handle, trim away any excess fat or tough membranes.
    Finely mince the heart and lungs.
    Coarsely grate about half of the cooked liver (the other half can be discarded or used for another purpose).
    Tip: Do not use all the liver, as its strong flavor can overwhelm the other ingredients. A coarse grate provides a better texture than fine mincing.
5. Mix the Haggis
    In a very large mixing bowl, combine the minced heart and lungs, the grated liver, the toasted oatmeal, the finely chopped suet, and the finely chopped onions.
    Add all the spices: salt, black pepper, coriander, nutmeg, and mace. Mix thoroughly with your hands to ensure everything is evenly distributed.
    Gradually add the reserved cooking stock to the mixture, about 1-2 cups. The filling should be moist and well-bound, but not wet or soupy.
6. Stuff the Haggis
    Carefully find the opening of the prepared sheep's stomach.
    Spoon the oatmeal-meat mixture into the casing.
    Crucial Step: Fill the bag only two-thirds (⅔) full. Do not overstuff it. The oatmeal will swell to nearly double its size, and overfilling is the primary reason a haggis will burst during cooking.
    Press all the air out of the casing and securely tie the opening shut with kitchen twine.
7. Simmer the Haggis
    Bring a very large pot of fresh water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a bare, gentle simmer (the water should just be "plobbing").
    Carefully lower the stuffed haggis into the water.
    Tip: Before putting it in, prick the haggis 2-3 times with a fine sewing needle. This allows trapped air to escape and is extra insurance against bursting.
    Let the haggis simmer very gently, uncovered, for 3 hours. Do not allow the water to return to a rolling boil.
8. Serve the Haggis
    Very carefully lift the cooked haggis from the pot, allowing the water to drain off.
    Place it on a warm serving platter and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
    To serve in the traditional style (often after an "Address to a Haggis"), present the haggis whole at the table. Cut it open lengthwise with a sharp knife, revealing the steaming, crumbly filling.
    Serve immediately with generous portions of neeps and tatties.
