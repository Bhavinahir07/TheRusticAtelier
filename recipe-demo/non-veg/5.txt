For the Stew:
    2 lbs boneless lamb shoulder (or neck), cut into 1.5-inch cubes
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper
    2 tbsp all-purpose flour
    2 tbsp vegetable oil or lard
    2 large yellow onions, thickly sliced
    3 large carrots, peeled and cut into thick rounds
    4 cups beef or lamb broth (low sodium)
    2-3 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried)
    2 bay leaves
For the Potatoes:
    1 lb Russet potatoes (starchy), peeled and roughly cubed
    1 lb Yukon Gold or red potatoes (waxy), peeled and cut into 1.5-inch chunks
For Serving:
    ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped
    Crusty brown bread

1. Prepare and Sear the Lamb
    Pat the lamb cubes thoroughly dry with paper towels. Season them generously with salt and pepper, then toss them in the all-purpose flour until lightly coated.
    Heat the oil or lard in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat.
    Working in two batches, sear the lamb on all sides until well-browned. This develops a deep, savory flavor. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the seared lamb to a clean plate.
    Comment: Do not overcrowd the pot while searing. Giving the meat space allows it to brown properly (Maillard reaction) rather than just steam.
2. Sauté the Aromatics
    Reduce the heat to medium. Add the sliced onions and carrots to the same pot, scraping up any browned bits (fond) from the bottom.
    Sauté for 5-7 minutes, until the onions have softened and the carrots are beginning to get tender.
3. Build the Stew Base
    Return the seared lamb (and any juices from the plate) to the pot with the vegetables.
    Add the Russet potatoes (the starchy ones), the beef or lamb broth, the fresh thyme sprigs, and the bay leaves. Stir everything together.
    Bring the liquid to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a low, gentle simmer.
4. The Long, Slow Simmer
    Cover the pot and let the stew simmer gently for 1 hour.
    Comment: During this first hour, the starchy Russet potatoes will begin to break down, dissolving into the broth and creating the stew's classic, creamy, natural thickness.
5. Add Waxy Potatoes and Finish
    After one hour, uncover the pot and add the Yukon Gold potatoes (the waxy ones).
    Stir gently, replace the cover, and continue to simmer for another 45 minutes to 1 hour.
    The stew is done when the lamb is fork-tender and the Yukon Gold potatoes are fully cooked but still hold their shape.
6. Final Touches
    Remove the pot from the heat. Fish out the bay leaves and the woody stems from the fresh thyme.
    Stir in the fresh chopped parsley. Taste the broth and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed.
    Tip: If the stew is too thick, stir in a splash of hot broth or water to reach your desired consistency.
7. Rest and Serve
    Let the stew rest, uncovered, for about 10 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and the stew to cool slightly.
    Ladle the hot stew into warm bowls and serve with thick slices of crusty brown bread for mopping up the gravy.
