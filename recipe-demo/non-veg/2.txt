For the Goulash Base:
    2 tbsp lard or vegetable oil
    2 large onions, finely chopped
    2 lbs beef chuck or shin, cut into 1-inch cubes
    2-3 cloves garlic, minced
    ¼ cup high-quality sweet Hungarian paprika
    1 tsp caraway seeds, crushed (optional but traditional)
    1 tsp dried marjoram
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
    6 cups beef broth or water (or a combination)
    1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
For the Vegetables:
    1 lb potatoes (like Yukon Gold), peeled and cut into ¾-inch cubes
    2 large carrots, peeled and sliced into thick rounds
    1 green bell pepper, seeded and diced (optional)

1. Sauté the Foundation Aromatics
    Heat the lard or oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
    Add the finely chopped onions and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes until they are deeply softened, translucent, and just beginning to caramelize.
    Comment: Taking the time to properly soften the onions is crucial. They will almost melt into the sauce, providing body and a subtle sweetness that balances the paprika.
2. Brown the Beef
    Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the cubed beef to the pot, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding.
    Sear the beef on all sides until nicely browned. Don't worry about cooking it through at this stage.
3. Bloom the Paprika
    Push the beef and onions to one side of the pot. Add the minced garlic to the cleared space and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
    Remove the pot from the heat temporarily. Add the sweet Hungarian paprika, crushed caraway seeds (if using), and dried marjoram directly to the pot. Stir everything together quickly to coat the meat and onions in the spices.
    Tip: This is the most critical step. Paprika burns easily and becomes bitter. Removing the pot from the heat prevents scorching while allowing the paprika's color and flavor to bloom in the residual heat and fat.
4. Deglaze and Simmer
    Return the pot to medium heat. Immediately pour in about 1 cup of the beef broth or water, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits (fond).
    Add the diced tomatoes (with their juice), the remaining broth/water, salt, and pepper. Stir everything together well.
    Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot tightly, and let it simmer gently for at least 1.5 hours, or until the beef is becoming tender.
5. Add Vegetables and Finish Cooking
    Stir in the cubed potatoes, sliced carrots, and diced green bell pepper (if using).
    Ensure the vegetables are mostly submerged in the liquid. If needed, add a little more broth or water.
    Replace the lid and continue to simmer for another 30-45 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the beef is fall-apart soft.
6. Adjust Seasoning and Serve
    Taste the goulash and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if necessary. The consistency should be like a thick soup or a light stew.
    Let the goulash rest off the heat for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld further.
    Ladle the hot goulash into bowls. It's traditionally served as is, perhaps with a dollop of sour cream or some crusty bread for dipping.
    Comment: Authentic Hungarian Goulash is often served simpler than versions found elsewhere, letting the rich paprika broth and tender meat and vegetables speak for themselves.
