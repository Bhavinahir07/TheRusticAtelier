For the Fondue:
    1 large clove of garlic, peeled and cut in half
    1 ½ cups dry, crisp white wine (like Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, or Swiss Chasselas)
    8 ounces (approx. 225g) high-quality Gruyère cheese, grated
    8 ounces (approx. 225g) high-quality Emmentaler cheese (or "Swiss cheese"), grated
    1 tbsp cornstarch
    1 tbsp Kirsch (cherry brandy)
    1 tsp fresh lemon juice (optional, helps keep cheese smooth)
    Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
    Pinch of ground white pepper
For Serving (Dippers):
    1 large loaf of crusty bread (like a baguette or peasant loaf), cut into 1-inch cubes
    Slices of apple or pear
    Blanched vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower)
    Cornichons (small gherkins)
    Boiled new potatoes

1. Prepare the Cheeses and Pot
    In a medium bowl, add the grated Gruyère and Emmentaler cheeses. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the cheese and toss with your hands until every shred is lightly coated.
    Comment: This step is the most important secret to a smooth, stable fondue. The cornstarch acts as an emulsifier and prevents the cheese proteins from clumping together and becoming stringy or separating from the wine.
    Take the halved garlic clove and rub the cut side vigorously all over the inside of a heavy-bottomed fondue pot (a caquelon) or an enameled cast-iron saucepan. Discard the garlic clove.
2. Heat the Wine
    Place the garlic-rubbed pot over medium heat.
    Pour in the white wine and the optional lemon juice. Heat the wine until it is hot and steaming, with small bubbles forming around the edges, but do not let it come to a full, rolling boil.
3. Melt the Cheese Gradually
    Reduce the heat to low. Begin adding the cornstarch-coated cheese to the hot wine, one small handful at a time.
    Stir constantly in a zig-zag or figure-eight pattern with a wooden spoon. Do not add the next handful of cheese until the previous one is almost fully melted.
    Tip: Do not rush this process. Adding the cheese too quickly or letting the mixture boil can cause the cheese to "seize" and become a lumpy, oily mess. Be patient and keep the heat low and steady.
4. Finish the Fondue
    Once all the cheese is smoothly melted into a creamy, homogenous sauce, stir in the Kirsch, nutmeg, and white pepper.
    If the fondue seems too thick, you can thin it out with a small splash of warm white wine.
5. Serve Immediately
    Transfer the pot immediately to its stand over the fondue burner (spirit lamp or sterno) on your table. Adjust the flame so it keeps the fondue warm and bubbling gently, but not scorching.
    Comment: The fondue will continue to cook at the table. It's important to stir the fondue with your bread cube each time you dip, scraping the bottom of the pot to prevent the cheese from burning and sticking.
    Arrange your cubed bread and other dippers around the pot and serve.
