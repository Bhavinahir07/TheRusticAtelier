For the Stew Base:
    4-6 ounces bacon (lardons), cut into small pieces
    3 lbs beef chuck roast, cut into 1.5 to 2-inch cubes
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper
    2 large carrots, peeled and sliced
    1 large yellow onion, chopped
    2 tbsp all-purpose flour
    1 bottle (750ml) dry red wine (like Burgundy, Pinot Noir, or Merlot)
    2-3 cups beef broth or stock
    1 tbsp tomato paste
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1 bouquet garni (parsley stems, 1 bay leaf, ½ tsp dried thyme tied in cheesecloth or with kitchen twine)
    1-2 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil (if needed)
For the Garnish (Optional but Traditional):
    1 lb cremini or button mushrooms, quartered
    1 tbsp butter
    1 cup pearl onions, peeled
    Fresh parsley, chopped (for serving)

1. Prepare the Bacon and Sear the Beef
    Place the cut bacon pieces (lardons) in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Cook slowly, rendering the fat, until the bacon is crisp, about 8-10 minutes.
    Remove the crispy bacon bits with a slotted spoon and set them aside on a paper towel-lined plate, leaving the rendered fat in the pot.
    Pat the beef cubes thoroughly dry with paper towels. Season generously with salt and pepper.
    Increase the heat to medium-high. Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot, sear the beef cubes in the hot bacon fat until deeply browned on all sides. Transfer the seared beef to the plate with the bacon. Add a little olive oil if the pot becomes too dry.
    Comment: Drying the beef and searing it well in batches is critical for developing the deep, savory foundation of the stew's flavor (Maillard reaction).
2. Sauté the Aromatics
    Reduce the heat to medium. Add the sliced carrots and chopped onion to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 8-10 minutes, until the vegetables are softened and lightly caramelized.
    Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more until fragrant.
3. Build the Braising Liquid
    Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables in the pot. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. This cooks out the raw flour taste and helps thicken the sauce later.
    Pour in the entire bottle of red wine. Bring it to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pot vigorously with a wooden spoon to dislodge all the flavorful browned bits (fond). Let the wine simmer and reduce slightly for 2-3 minutes.
    Stir in the tomato paste until it dissolves. Return the seared beef and cooked bacon (and any accumulated juices) to the pot.
    Add enough beef broth so the meat is almost, but not fully, submerged. Tuck the bouquet garni into the liquid. Season lightly with salt and pepper (remember the bacon and broth are salty).
4. The Slow Braise
    Bring the stew to a gentle simmer on the stovetop. Once simmering, cover the pot tightly with its lid.
    Transfer the covered pot to a preheated oven at 325°F (160°C).
    Braise in the oven for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the beef is exceptionally tender when pierced with a fork. Check occasionally and add more broth if the liquid level gets too low.
    Tip: Oven braising provides gentle, even heat, perfect for making the beef meltingly tender without drying out.
5. Prepare the Garnish (Optional)
    While the beef braises, melt 1 tbsp butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the quartered mushrooms and cook until nicely browned and tender, about 5-7 minutes. Set aside.
    If using pearl onions, you can sauté them in the same skillet until lightly browned and tender.
6. Finish and Serve
    Once the beef is tender, remove the pot from the oven. Discard the bouquet garni. Skim any excess fat from the surface of the stew if desired.
    If you want a thicker sauce, you can make a beurre manié by mashing 1 tbsp softened butter with 1 tbsp flour into a paste. Whisk small bits of this paste into the simmering stew until it reaches your desired consistency. Alternatively, use a cornstarch slurry.
    Stir the reserved sautéed mushrooms and pearl onions (if using) into the stew.
    Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.
    Let the Beef Bourguignon rest for about 10-15 minutes before serving.
    Ladle generously into bowls, sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley, and serve hot, traditionally with mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or crusty bread.
