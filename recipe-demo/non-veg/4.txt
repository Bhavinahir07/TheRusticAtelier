For the Sofrito and Base:
    ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
    1 large onion, finely chopped
    1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
    4 cloves garlic, minced
    1 large ripe tomato, grated (skin discarded) or ½ cup crushed tomatoes
    1 tsp smoked paprika (Pimentón de la Vera)
    Large pinch of saffron threads
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper
For the Paella:
    1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
    ½ lb chorizo sausage, sliced (optional, adds flavor)
    2 cups Spanish short-grain rice (Bomba or Calasparra preferred)
    6 cups hot chicken or seafood broth (low sodium)
    ½ lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined
    ½ lb mussels or clams, scrubbed
    ½ cup green beans (runner beans or flat beans), trimmed and cut
    ½ cup cold hard peas
    Lemon wedges, for serving
    Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

1. Prepare the Saffron and Broth
    Crumble the saffron threads into a small bowl. Add 2-3 tablespoons of the hot broth, stir, and let the saffron infuse for at least 15 minutes to release its color and aroma.
    Keep the remaining broth simmering gently in a separate saucepan.
2. Brown the Meats
    Heat the olive oil in a large paella pan (at least 15-inch diameter) over medium-high heat.
    Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Add them to the hot pan and cook until nicely browned on all sides. Remove the chicken and set aside.
    If using chorizo, add the slices to the pan and cook for a couple of minutes until they render some fat and become slightly crisp. Remove and set aside with the chicken.
3. Build the Sofrito Flavor Base
    Reduce the heat to medium. Add the chopped onion and bell pepper to the same pan, using the flavorful fat left from the meats. Cook, stirring often, for 8-10 minutes until softened and translucent.
    Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more until fragrant.
    Stir in the grated tomato and smoked paprika. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring, until the tomato darkens slightly and the mixture thickens. This concentrated flavor base is the sofrito.
4. Incorporate the Rice and Liquids
    Add the rice to the paella pan. Stir it constantly for 1-2 minutes to coat the grains with the sofrito and oil.
    Pour in the hot broth and the saffron-infused liquid. Stir in the green beans. Season generously with salt and pepper.
    Bring the liquid to a strong simmer. Taste the broth and adjust seasoning if needed – it should taste slightly salty, as the rice will absorb salt as it cooks.
5. Arrange Toppings and Cook the Rice (No Stirring!)
    Once simmering strongly, arrange the browned chicken (and chorizo, if using) pieces evenly throughout the pan. Scatter the peas over the top.
    Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle, steady simmer across the entire surface of the pan.
    Crucial Step: Do NOT stir the rice from this point forward. Let it simmer undisturbed for about 10 minutes.
    After 10 minutes, nestle the shrimp and mussels (hinge-side down) into the rice.
    Continue simmering gently for another 8-10 minutes, until the rice has absorbed almost all the liquid, the shrimp are pink, and the mussels have opened. (Discard any mussels that do not open).
6. Achieve the Socarrat (Optional but Recommended)
    Once the liquid is nearly fully absorbed, increase the heat to medium-high for about 60-90 seconds. Listen carefully for a gentle crackling sound and watch for a slightly toasted aroma. This indicates the bottom layer of rice is crisping up to form the socarrat.
    Tip: Be very careful not to burn the bottom. This step requires close attention. If you smell burning, remove from heat immediately.
7. Rest the Paella
    Remove the paella pan from the heat. Cover it loosely with aluminum foil or a clean kitchen towel.
    Let the paella rest for 10 minutes. This allows the rice to finish steaming, the flavors to meld, and the remaining moisture to distribute evenly.
8. Garnish and Serve
    Uncover the paella. Garnish generously with chopped fresh parsley.
    Serve directly from the pan, providing lemon wedges for guests to squeeze over their portions. Traditionally, guests eat directly from the pan, especially the crispy bits scraped from the bottom.
