For the Dough:
    4 cups (500g) bread flour (high-gluten flour)
    1 ½ tsp (8g) salt
    1 tbsp (15g) granulated sugar
    2 tsp (8g) instant yeast
    1 ½ tbsp (20g) unsalted butter, softened
    1 ¼ cups (300ml) lukewarm water
For the Water Bath & Topping:
    3 quarts (approx. 3L) water
    1 tbsp honey or barley malt syrup (for the water)
    1 large egg, beaten (for an egg wash, optional for shine)
    Toppings: sesame seeds, poppy seeds, coarse salt

1. Create the Dough
    In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the bread flour, salt, sugar, and instant yeast.
    Add the softened butter and the lukewarm water.
    Using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until a shaggy dough comes together. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 8-10 minutes, until the dough is very smooth, elastic, and strong.
    Tip: The dough should be quite stiff, similar to a New York bagel dough. This is necessary for it to hold its braided shape.
2. First Rise
    Form the dough into a smooth ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat.
    Cover the bowl with a damp cloth or plastic wrap.
    Let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place for 60-90 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.
3. The Signature Braided Shape
    Gently deflate the risen dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface.
    Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces (about 100g each).
    Working with one piece at a time (keep the others covered), divide it into two smaller, equal-sized balls.
    Roll each small ball into a long, thin rope, about 1-inch thick and 16-18 inches long.
    Place the two ropes parallel to each other. Pinch them together at one end, then twist them around each other to form a braid.
    Comment: This twist, or sulki, is the defining characteristic of an Obwarzanek.
    Form the braid into a circle and pinch the two ends together very firmly to seal the ring. Place the shaped ring on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
    Repeat with the remaining dough, leaving a few inches of space between each ring.
4. Set Up for Cooking
    Let the shaped rings rest, uncovered, for about 15-20 minutes while you prepare the next step.
    Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
    In a large, wide pot, bring the 3 quarts of water and 1 tablespoon of honey to a rolling boil.
5. Boil the Rings
    Carefully lower 2-3 of the dough rings into the boiling water. Do not overcrowd the pot.
    Boil them for about 45-60 seconds on each side. They will puff up slightly and float.
    Tip: The honey in the water adds a subtle sweetness and helps create a shiny, golden-brown crust during baking.
    Use a large slotted spoon or spider skimmer to remove the boiled rings, letting the excess water drip off. Place them back on the parchment-lined baking sheet.
6. Top and Bake
    If you want a deeper brown color, brush the boiled rings with the optional egg wash.
    While the dough is still wet, sprinkle your toppings (sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or coarse salt) generously over the rings.
    Immediately transfer the baking sheets to the preheated oven.
    Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the Obwarzanki are a deep, glossy golden-brown and feel firm to the touch.
7. Cool and Serve
    Transfer the finished Obwarzanki to a wire rack to cool completely.
    Comment: These are traditionally sold from street carts in Kraków and eaten plain, as a hand-held snack. They are best enjoyed the day they are made.
