For the Schnitzel:
    4 veal cutlets (from the top round or leg), about 5-6 ounces (150g) each
    ¾ cup all-purpose flour
    2 large eggs
    2 tbsp heavy cream
    1 ½ cups very fine, plain breadcrumbs
    Salt
    Approx. 2 cups neutral oil (like canola) and ½ cup clarified butter (or lard) for frying
For Serving:
    1 lemon, cut into wedges
    Fresh parsley, chopped
    Lingonberry jam (optional)
    Parsley potatoes or a simple Austrian potato salad (optional side)

1. Prepare the Veal
    Place one veal cutlet at a time between two large sheets of plastic wrap.
    Using the flat side of a meat mallet, pound the cutlets, starting from the center and working your way out. The goal is to get them uniformly paper-thin, about ⅛-inch (4-5mm).
    Comment: This is the most important preparation step. Pounding the veal not only makes it incredibly large and thin but also tenderizes the meat, ensuring it cooks in seconds.
2. Set Up the "Breading Street"
    Prepare three large, shallow dishes for the Schnitzelstraße (schnitzel street).
    Dish 1: Add the all-purpose flour.
    Dish 2: Lightly whisk the eggs with the heavy cream. Do not beat them too much; some streaks are fine.
    Dish 3: Spread the fine breadcrumbs in an even layer.
    Season both sides of the pounded veal cutlets generously with salt.
3. Bread the Veal
    Working one cutlet at a time, dredge it in the flour, coating both sides. Gently tap off all the excess flour.
    Immediately transfer the floured cutlet to the egg wash. Dip it, ensuring all surfaces are coated. Lift the cutlet and let the excess egg wash drip off for a few seconds.
    Finally, place the cutlet in the breadcrumbs. Gently coat both sides, but do not press the breadcrumbs into the meat. The breading should be loose.
    Tip: This "no-press" technique is the secret to the airy, souffléd crust. Pressing the crumbs on will make the breading dense and flat. Work quickly and fry immediately after breading.
4. Pan-Fry the Schnitzel
    In a very large, deep skillet, add enough oil and clarified butter (or lard) to a depth of at least 1-1.5 inches. The schnitzel must be able to "swim" freely in the fat.
    Heat the fat to 340-350°F (170-175°C). If you don't have a thermometer, a small piece of breadcrumb should sizzle and turn golden instantly.
    Carefully slide one breaded schnitzel into the hot fat, laying it away from you to avoid splashing. Do not crowd the pan; cook only one or two at a time.
    Fry for 2-3 minutes, continuously shaking the pan in a gentle, swirling motion. This helps the hot fat wash over the top of the schnitzel, causing the breading to puff up and get wavy.
    When the bottom is deep golden brown, carefully flip the schnitzel with a wide spatula. Fry for another 2-3 minutes on the other side, continuing to shake the pan, until it's also golden and crisp.
5. Drain and Serve Immediately
    Using the spatula, remove the cooked schnitzel from the pan, allowing the excess fat to drip off.
    Transfer it to a wire rack (not paper towels) to keep the bottom side crispy.
    Garnish with a sprinkle of fresh parsley and serve immediately.
    Comment: A Wiener Schnitzel waits for no one. It must be served piping hot from the pan to be at its best. It is traditionally served with a lemon wedge, which is squeezed over the schnitzel at the table to cut the richness of the fat.
