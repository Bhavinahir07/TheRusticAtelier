For the Pintxos (makes 12):
    12 high-quality, salt-cured anchovy fillets (packed in olive oil)
    12 large, pitted green olives (Manzanilla is traditional)
    24 pickled Guindilla peppers (the long, thin, mild Basque green peppers)
    High-quality Spanish extra virgin olive oil (for drizzling)
    12 small wooden skewers or toothpicks

1. Prepare the Ingredients
    Remove the anchovy fillets from their oil, letting the excess drip off.
    Drain the pitted olives from their brine.
    Drain the Guindilla peppers from their pickling liquid.
    Tip: For the best presentation, you can gently pat the ingredients with a paper towel, but a little of the oil and brine adds to the flavor.
2. Assemble the Pintxo
    Take one small wooden skewer.
    There are two common ways to assemble the Gilda; the "classic fold" is most traditional.
    Classic Fold Assembly:
        Take one Guindilla pepper and thread the bottom end onto the skewer.
        Take one anchovy fillet and fold it over itself (like an accordion). Thread the folded anchovy onto the skewer.
        Thread one green olive onto the skewer.
        Finally, fold the top half of the Guindilla pepper back and thread it onto the end of the skewer, "bookending" the other ingredients.
3. (Alternative) Simple Stack Assembly
    Take one anchovy fillet and fold or roll it up.
    Take one Guindilla pepper and fold it in half or into thirds.
    On the skewer, simply thread the olive, then the folded anchovy, then the folded pepper.
    Comment: This method is faster and very common, but the "Classic Fold" provides a bite of pepper at both the beginning and the end.
4. Serve Immediately
    Arrange the assembled Gilda pintxos on a small platter or plate.
    Just before serving, drizzle them generously with high-quality extra virgin olive oil.
    Tip: Pintxos are designed to be eaten in one or two bites. They are traditionally served at a bar, accompanied by a small glass of Txakoli (a spritzy Basque white wine), a zurito (a small glass of beer), or a glass of cider.
