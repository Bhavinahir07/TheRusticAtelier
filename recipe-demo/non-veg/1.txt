For the Sausage:
    4-6 high-quality German sausages (Bratwurst or Bockwurst)
    1 tbsp vegetable oil or butter (for frying)
For the Curry Ketchup Sauce:
    1 tbsp vegetable oil
    1 large onion, very finely diced
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    2 tbsp mild curry powder
    1 tsp hot paprika (or sweet paprika, to taste)
    1 (15 ounce / 400g) can crushed tomatoes (or tomato passata)
    ½ cup water or beef broth
    3 tbsp apple cider vinegar
    2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
    3 tbsp brown sugar (or honey, to taste)
    1 tsp salt
    ½ tsp black pepper
For Serving:
    Mild curry powder (for dusting)
    French fries (Pommes) or a crispy bread roll (Brötchen)

1. Prepare the Curry Ketchup Sauce
    Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the finely diced onion and sauté for 5-7 minutes, until very soft and translucent.
    Add the minced garlic and cook for one minute more until fragrant.
    Add the 2 tbsp of curry powder and the paprika. Stir constantly for 30-60 seconds until the spices are toasted and highly aromatic.
    Comment: Toasting the spices in the hot oil before adding liquid is a crucial step. It "blooms" the spices, deepening their flavor and removing any raw, powdery taste.
2. Simmer the Sauce
    Pour in the crushed tomatoes, water (or broth), apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar. Whisk to combine everything thoroughly.
    Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low. Let the sauce simmer, partially covered, for at least 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it has thickened and the flavors have melded.
    Tip: For an ultra-smooth, professional-style sauce like those at a German Imbiss, use an immersion blender to puree the sauce until it is completely smooth.
3. Cook the Sausages
    While the sauce simmers, prepare the Wurst. Heat 1 tbsp of oil or butter in a large skillet (frying pan) over medium-high heat.
    Add the sausages to the pan and cook for 8-10 minutes, turning them frequently, until they are browned and sizzling on all sides and cooked through.
    Comment: You can also grill the sausages for a smokier flavor, which is also very traditional.
4. Assemble the Dish
    Remove the cooked sausages from the pan and place them on a cutting board.
    Slice each sausage into thick, bite-sized pieces, about 1-inch thick.
    Arrange the sliced sausage on a plate, typically alongside a generous portion of hot french fries.
5. Sauce and Serve
    Be generous. Pour a large amount of the hot curry ketchup sauce directly over the sliced sausage, "drowning" them in it.
    Finish the dish with one final, authentic touch: a light dusting of mild curry powder over the top of the sauce.
    Serve immediately.
