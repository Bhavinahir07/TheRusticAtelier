For the Dough (Testo):
    2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
    ½ cup (120ml) lukewarm water
    1 tbsp vegetable oil
    1 tsp white vinegar
    ½ tsp salt
    Extra oil for coating
For the Filling (Nadev):
    1 lb (approx. 450g) dry curd cottage cheese or quark (skuta), well-drained
    ½ cup sour cream
    1 large egg yolk
    ½ tsp salt (or to taste)
For Cooking and Topping:
    1 large, clean cotton kitchen towel (no fabric softener residue)
    Kitchen twine
    4 tbsp unsalted butter
    ½ cup plain breadcrumbs

1. Prepare the Dough
    In a medium bowl, combine the flour and salt. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the lukewarm water, oil, and vinegar.
    Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the wet ingredients. Gradually mix with a fork, then your hands, until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms.
    Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth, elastic, and pliable.
    Form the dough into a ball, lightly coat it with oil, place it back in the bowl, cover, and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
    Comment: Resting the dough is essential. It allows the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch thinly later.
2. Mix the Cottage Cheese Filling
    While the dough rests, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the well-drained cottage cheese (or quark), sour cream, egg yolk, and salt.
    Mix well until evenly combined. The filling should be thick and spreadable.
    Tip: Ensure your cottage cheese is as dry as possible. If it seems wet, you can press out excess moisture using cheesecloth.
3. Roll Out and Fill the Dough
    Lay your clean kitchen towel flat on a large work surface and dust it generously with flour.
    Place the rested dough ball in the center of the floured towel. Using a rolling pin, begin rolling the dough out from the center, aiming for a large, thin rectangle.
    Once partially rolled, gently use the backs of your hands to stretch the dough further, aiming for paper-thinness, similar to strudel dough. Trim any thick edges.
    Spread the cottage cheese filling evenly over the entire surface of the stretched dough, leaving about a 1-inch border along one long edge.
4. Form and Wrap the Roll
    Starting from the long edge opposite the clean border, use the kitchen towel underneath to help lift and tightly roll the dough into a long log, like a jelly roll or strudel.
    Carefully wrap the rolled štruklji log snugly inside the floured kitchen towel. Twist the ends of the towel and tie them securely with kitchen twine, like a large sausage. Tie another piece of twine around the middle if the roll is very long.
    Comment: Wrapping in the towel is the traditional method. It protects the delicate dough during boiling and helps it keep its shape.
5. Simmer the Štruklji
    Bring a large, wide pot of salted water to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat so it is just barely simmering.
    Carefully lower the towel-wrapped štruklji roll into the simmering water. Ensure it is fully submerged.
    Simmer gently, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes. Do not allow the water to boil vigorously.
6. Rest, Unwrap, and Slice
    Using tongs or two large spoons, carefully lift the cooked štruklji roll out of the water and place it on a cutting board or platter.
    Let it rest, still wrapped in the towel, for 10-15 minutes.
    Tip: This resting step is crucial. It allows the štruklji to firm up slightly so it doesn't fall apart when you unwrap and slice it.
    Carefully unwrap the štruklji from the towel. Using a sharp knife, cut the log into thick slices, about 1.5 to 2 inches wide.
7. Prepare Topping and Serve
    While the štruklji rests, melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat.
    Add the breadcrumbs and toast, stirring constantly, until they are golden brown and fragrant, about 3-5 minutes.
    Arrange the warm štruklji slices on plates and generously sprinkle the toasted buttered breadcrumbs over the top.
    Serve immediately as a comforting main course or a substantial side dish.
