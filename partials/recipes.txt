Ingredients

    For the Cake
        2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour – gives the cake structure
        2 tsp baking powder – helps the cake rise evenly
        1 ½ tsp baking soda – extra lift and moisture retention
        ½ tsp salt – balances sweetness
        2 tsp ground cinnamon – the signature warm spice
        ½ tsp ground nutmeg – adds depth of flavor
        ½ tsp ground ginger (optional) – for a gentle spicy kick
        1 cup (200 g) brown sugar – adds moisture and caramel notes
        1 cup (200 g) white sugar – for sweetness and structure
        1 cup (240 ml) vegetable oil (neutral, e.g., sunflower/canola) – keeps the cake moist (oil works better than butter here)
        4 large eggs – bind ingredients and add richness
        2 tsp vanilla extract – enhances flavor
        3 cups (300 g) freshly grated carrots (about 4–5 medium carrots) – finely grated for even distribution
        1 cup (100 g) chopped walnuts or pecans (optional) – add crunch and nutty flavor
        ½ cup (80 g) raisins (optional) – for bursts of sweetness (can be soaked in warm water or rum for extra plumpness)

    For the Cream Cheese Frosting
        8 oz (225 g) cream cheese, softened – must be full-fat for best results
        ½ cup (115 g) unsalted butter, softened – adds richness and stability
        3 ½ cups (420 g) powdered sugar, sifted – ensures a smooth, lump-free frosting
        2 tsp vanilla extract – for flavor depth

Instructions
1. Preheat & Prepare

Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).

Grease and flour two 9-inch (23 cm) round cake pans, or line with parchment paper.

Tip: Lining pans with parchment ensures the cakes release easily and stay intact.

2. Mix Dry Ingredients

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.

Tip: Sifting dry ingredients makes the cake lighter.

3. Mix Wet Ingredients

In a large bowl, beat eggs, both sugars, oil, and vanilla until smooth and slightly thickened.

The oil ensures lasting moisture, even if refrigerated.

4. Combine

Gradually add dry mixture to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Avoid overmixing.

Gently fold in grated carrots, nuts, and raisins (if using).

Tip: Folding keeps the batter airy — overmixing can make the cake dense.

5. Bake

Divide the batter evenly into pans.

Bake for 40–45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes, then carefully transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

Cooling fully before frosting is essential — warm cake will melt the frosting.

6. Make Frosting

In a medium bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until creamy and smooth.

Gradually add powdered sugar and vanilla, beating until fluffy.

If frosting feels too soft, chill for 15 minutes before using.

7. Assemble

Place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread frosting on top.

Place the second layer over it and frost the top and sides evenly.

Garnish with chopped walnuts, pecans, or decorative carrot curls.

For bakery-style presentation, use an offset spatula for smooth edges.

✅ Professional Tips

Grate carrots fresh – pre-shredded packaged ones are too dry and coarse.

Optional pineapple twist – some bakers add ½ cup crushed pineapple (drained) for extra moisture.

Storage – keep frosted cake covered in the fridge up to 5 days; bring to room temperature before serving.

Make-ahead – cake layers can be baked a day in advance and wrapped tightly; frost the next day.

Frosting upgrade – add a teaspoon of lemon zest to frosting for brightness.
